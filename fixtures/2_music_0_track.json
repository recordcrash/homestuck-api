But only one of the years that there has been in all of history has had a baby born who, inside of him, has had all the powers of a higher deity. It is on this god-child's birthday that everyone, more or less, will gather around with their families and buy expensive things for people they love dearly. Now, we in the Incipisphere celebrate Christmas too, oh no no no don't get me wrong, we love Christmas. But our Christmasses are a little bit different. You see, our Christmas time festivities don't have a-a Frosty o-or a Rudolph, because we don't accept the Christmas apocrypha as canonical, and we don't own radios because of how poor we are. So we don't know what a Frank Sinatra or-or a Bing Crosby is. But if you point your ears at the sky and listen, real real careful, on Christmas morning, you might just hear us Skaians singing our Christmas Carol.)",

She's a gal with a knack for justice and has the force under her thumb. He's a guy who just joined the APD and finding his bearings is about as easy as feeding a Gyclops his cough syrup. And together, they are Trollcops.\nIt isn't going to be easy teaching the rookie the ropes of the force, but she's the only one who can do it without getting him killed. So far the biggest problem they've hit is striking the right chord with each other. It seems like whenever they're partners, there isn't a moment when they're not both at each other's throats. It's gonna take a miracle to find a middle road with this pair, and keep their antics under the hat.\nHowever, if it weren't for that kartheft, the team would'a never gotten their issues ironed out. Now, they stick together like glue and macaroni and keep Alternia shining like a green sun. One thing's for sure, if you cause trouble in their neighborhood, these two will sort you out quick, because together, they are...trollcops.",

To hear one night those muted pawpads traipse up your stairs. A low but friendly growl unsettles your slumber, and as the sopor seeps from your eyes they detect a sharp pair of ears cutting moonlight. A mysterious wolven tongue invites. Wouldn't these ears suit you? Would not this proud long snout assist you in the hunt?\nWhat a daring dream...\n(Just what do you think you're planning on doing with that ring?)<br>(Whatever it is forget it)<br>(The Slayer is miiiiiiiine)<br>(Now w8ke up)<br>(I said W88888888KE!)",

    "lyrics": "[[track:fanfare|-FANFARE-]]\nGFD: Welcome to \"Holy Shit, Sesame Street's YouTube was porned, and also I guess Jailbreak is happening\".\nRJ!: It's the album commentary, yeah.\nNick: This is... Welcome, this is me.\n\n[[track:jailstuck-intro|-JAILSTUCK (INTRO)-]]\nRJ!: That was Nick Smalley, uh, I am Robert J! Lake, uh...\nJit: And... I'm Jit.\nGFD: And nobody knows who I am.\nNick: That's GFD.\nJit: Yeah.\nRJ!: Luke Benjamins.\nGFD: Sup.\nRJ!: And this is [[album:jailbreak-vol-1|Jailbreak]] we're listening to right now.\nNick: It's a good album, man.\nJit: Yeah.\nRJ!: It's a really good album, it's all chiptunes.\nGFD: Almost.\nNick: Almost all chiptunes, I mean— RJ!: Mostly chiptunes. Nick: —some of us skipped out and cheated, you know, unlike me and GFD here, we were authentic.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: I don't know how to authentic chiptunes, I uh, made a compromise with myself that all of the sounds I used are going to be synthesized chiptunes. So, it's all not edited. It's all as chiptune as I can make it.\nNick: That's alright. I mean, things like this. It's pretty good.\nGFD: I don't remember hearing this track before.\nRJ!: This is one of the ones that I didn't upload ever.\nGFD: Oh.\nRJ!: This is [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]].\nNick: That's totally fine.\nGFD: I like this one.\nNick: It's got a cool vibe. Jit: Yeah, it's cool, I guess.\nRJ!: Yeah, this is the intro, and then the next one is... what the intro leads into.\nNick: That makes sense.\nRJ!: Mhmm.\nJit: Wait, wait, is this intro done now or...?\nRJ!: No. Jit: I have no idea, oh, okay.\nRJ!: You got— Jit: Yeah, I don't think I've actually listened to a lot of this stuff, or I've listened to it and then just kinda: you'll file it away without remembering any about it. So, it's like I'm listening to this for the first time too!\nGFD: I only listened to the stuff that was in the Google Doc, recently. And—\nNick: Yeah, I haven't listened to it recently.\n\n[[track:title-screen|-TITLE SCREEN-]]\nGFD: —and from a long time ago, when I got a bunch of MP3s from everybody from the forums 'cause I can't the forums.\nRJ!: Mhmm.\nJit: Oh man...\nNick: Is this still [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]]? Jit: I love this percussion.\nGFD: Yes.\nRJ!: What?\nNick: [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]] is forever.\nRJ!: Uh, no no, this is after [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]]. This is the main title.\nJit: Oh. Nick: Okay. Press start to play... slash die.\nRJ!: Yeah.\nNick: Man, [imitates beat of the song], this would go great with a pendulum song.\n[laughter]\nRJ!: Ah, it's not 174 BPM.\nNick: How much is it?\nRJ!: Uh... it's 15-... it's 150, 160 something in that area.\nNick: That's pretty close, we could do it.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's true. Jit: Yeah, you could just turn it up a little bit.\nRJ!: Yeah, mash that shit up.\nNick: I could do it.\nRJ!: [falsetto] This piece is a long time coming, augh, you don't understaaand.\nNick: It's me, pendulum, slam slam. That was a good song.  GFD: Okay...\nJit: Oh no, this track is ending. RJ!: And now, we got— Jit: What's next? GFD: Wow, what?\nRJ!: Now, it's uh... GFD. Jit: I hope it's not anything of mine.\nGFD: It's mine next?\n\n[[track:logorg|-LOGORG-]]\nGFD: Ah, here we go.\nNick: [[track:logorg|Logorg]].\nRJ!: [[track:logorg|Logorg]].\nGFD: The first track that's not— Jit: Oh yeah, this one's great. GFD: —the first one that's not RJ.\nRJ!: Yeah, I kind of accidentally became the album. Half of it.\nNick: Yeah, I know, because a lot of people didn't want to be on the album because, like \"ugh, chiptunes are so bad\".\nRJ!: And I was just like, oh my god, I love chiptunes. It's my thing.\nJit: Yeah, I just never got back around to being bored of my own...\nGFD: If, uh... You guys should listen to this one, the NSF, in VirtuaNES as well because it sounds pretty cool in that. For a lot of other [unintelligible]— Jit: \"Virtual NES\", what?\nGFD: —I'm talking to the people who listening to us doing the commentary.\nJit: Because I don't what \"Virtual NES\" is. Tell me, GFD!\nGFD: It's a NES emulator that also plays NSFs, and doesn't—\nRJ!: It'll be in the extras. It'll be in the extras for the people listening, I'll have a link to it.\nGFD: Yeah, yeah. It's one of the only NSF players that doesn't screw the song up because I like, used stuff you're not supposed to do in Famitracker— RJ!: He cheated. GFD: —to make it sound this way.\nGFD: I'm a cheater.\nJit: Oh... Yeah, well, I doubt RJ actually made anything in Famitracker, so yeah...\nRJ!: I have samples from Famitracker. GFD: Eeeh.\nJit: That doesn't count.\nRJ!: Yeah, it does.\nJit: That's like \"using a leaf\" versus \"sampling a leaf\".\n\n[[track:elf-shanty|-ELF SHANTY-]]\nGFD: Wait, whose song is this now?\nRJ!: Uh, this is the only one that AgentParsec [Note: Mark Hadley] has in the album, this is [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]].\nGFD: Oh, right! I forgot about this one.\nNick: That elf.\nGFD: I remember this one, this is catchy.\nRJ!: Mhmm. GFD: Do we have an NSF of this one either?\nRJ!: Uh, I don't think he NSF'd this one, I think this is fake. I'm not sure though.\nGFD: Oh... sad.\nJit: I don't know, that percussion sounds awfully familiar.\nGFD: No, this sounds... this sounds like it was made in Famitracker. Can we get an NSF from him before we release the album?\nRJ!: We'd have to talk to him, though. Um, I want to have released it today and we're burning the afternoon oil right now.\nGFD: Let's see if you can find him, 'cause... for, I want NSFs for this.\nRJ!: He's got a baby though, now.\nGFD: [incredulous] He's got a baby?\nNick: Yeah, he does have a baby— GFD: What's he—? Nick: —don't you remember? GFD: What's he—?\nRJ!: So, it'd kinda make things more...\nGFD: What's he—? Jit: The baby's probably like months old by this point.\nGFD: What's he doing making babies? He should be making music.\nNick: Don't you remember?\nGFD: Great, so now we don't have NSFs.\nRJ!: He was busy watching the Sesame Street YouTube, that's how it happened.\nGFD: Oh. Oh, I see.\nNick: He was trying to figure out how, and then he watched Sesame Street.\n[laughter] Nick: Topical!\nRJ!: That's real family entertainment right there.\nNick: I don't know, this doesn't sound like something in Famitracker.\nGFD: Yes, it does. (What are) you on?\nJit: Yeah, it does.\nNick: Fine, you win. GFD: And hasn't Parsec made stuff in Famitracker before?\nNick: [[track:harlequin|Harlequin]]?\nGFD: Yeah, er, wait... Jit: [[track:aggrieve|Aggrieve]]?\nGFD: Was it him that made the [[track:problem-sleuth-theme|title screen for Problem Sleuth]]?\nNick: Yes. GFD: Because that was in... that was in Famitracker.\nJit: It would make sense.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's probably him. Nick: In fact, if it weren't for Parsec, I wouldn't be on the music team.\nRJ!: Really? GFD: Really?\nNick: Uh huh.\nGFD: How did he, you, the music team?\nNick: Because I heard the [[track:problem-sleuth-theme|Problem Sleuth opening theme]] and I was like, I could do that.\nGFD: Ah.\nNick: And then, I sent music to Andrew and then he invited me into the music team [unintelligible].\nGFD: I don't even know how I got in. I literally have no idea. Jit: Yeah, me either.\nGFD: I was just, sort of, there all of a sudden... And then I wasn't, waaah.\nJit: Well, you like, applied at one point, I'm sure.\nGFD: Oh yeah, but I don't even remember if I put music in that email, actually.\n[laughter]\nRJ!: I'm here because Adghar [Note: Andrew Huo]...\nJit: Did the three of us like, \"I can make music\" and then you got in, and were just like \"I'm not making any music, right now.\"\nRJ!: I really wish I actually like, actively applied. I'm only here because, um, Adghar posted a bunch of people who were apparently like supposed... You know, music team candidates. Possible people. He listed me as um, \"psychedelic rock\".\nNick: Cool. Jit: Interesting.\n\n[[track:phantom-echoes|-PHANTOM ECHOES-]]\nNick: I love this song, oh my god.\nRJ!: Me too! Jesus Christ, it reminds me of Cave Story to uh, [unintelligible]. Is this done in PxTone?\nGFD: No, uh, the percussion... Jit: It sounds like it was in PxTone.\nGFD: Is the whole thing in PxTone? I thought it was like...\nRJ!: This sounds a lot like PxTone.\nGFD: Ah... that explains it.\nNick: It sounds a lot like it'd be in PxTone.\nGFD: [imitating song]\nNick: Yeah, you don't get that uh... sine wave in anything but, like, PxTone.\nGFD: Yee.\nRJ!: It's... Ohhh my goddd!\n[laughter]\nJit: Who made this one?\nRJ!: This is, uh, [noises] vavoom! Adghar, right?\nNick: Yeah. RJ!: That's Adghar.\nGFD: Yeah.\nJit: I don't remember him making stuff in ages.\nGFD: The OTHER Andrew H. Jit: He's pretty old.\n[laughter]\nGFD: He made two songs for this one, didn't he? ...no, three. One is the bonus track.\nNick: This is Andrew Hussie's Asian doppelganger. [laughter]\nRJ!: The one who plays violin. Jit: Yeah, the one that never actually like, makes hardly anything.\nNick: I agree.\nRJ!: Well, he's still definitely around. I mean, he gave me— This is a fresh WAV.\nNick: Yeah, this is like hot off the presses.\nJit: Cool. Nick: [imitating newspaper machine noises] RJ!: Yeah.\nJit: I mean, I know he still hangs around and such, but...\nGFD: I mean, he was definitely active for the \"Doctor Space\" thing that never happened.\nRJ!: We can't talk about that, can we?\nGFD: We can't? Nick: No.\nGFD: Oh, okay. I never said anything.\nRJ!: That's a tantalizing, tantalizing behind-the-scenes tidbit you all got there, guys.\nGFD: Yeah.\nJit: Yeah, \"Doctor Space\" is just like Doctor...\nRJ!: Never happened. Jit: In space.\nNick: It's an animated series like Dr. House, but it's in space.\n[collective laughter]\nGFD: I feel like that would be better than what we had it as.\nRJ!: No more talking. Jit: Okay.\n\n[[track:assail|-ASSAIL-]]\nNick: I love this one.\nRJ!: I love this one too. Hi, Jit.\nNick: Forget everything else, this song's the best.\nJit: Hi... yeah... it's like— RJ!: This is one of my favorites.\nGFD: Jit, how did— Jit: It's like, god, this thing is so freaking old. This is before Dave had a fight theme, and I was like, \"I'll try making one\".\nRJ!: I actually wish this was the fight theme over [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]].\nNick: Mmm.\nGFD: Jit— Jit: I don't know, [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]] was cool though.\nGFD: How do you feel about—  Jit: It's just like... RJ!: [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]], I like... I like [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]] but... I like this more.\nGFD: Jit, how do you feel about yourself when you listen to this?\nJit: Um... Nick: Probably the same way you feel about how you listen to your stuff.\nGFD: I feel amazing.\nJit: It's like... I don't know, I think it could've been better 'cause Famitracker could do a whole lot more as evidenced by like, [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]]. But it kinda shows like my inexperience with the whole thing in general.\nRJ!: But, I don't like [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]] as much as this.\nNick: I don't like [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]]. It's not my favorite. Jit: Oh you shut your face. You shut your face, RJ.\nRJ!: It's true, though, this is awesome and I kinda... Like, I look at [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]] as this weird little, kind of off-side thing that's not as good as Beatfox's [Note: Seth Peelle] other stuff.\nNick: Yeah.\nJit: Have you seen the Famitracker file for it though? It's crazy.\nRJ!: That doesn't make it good, that just means it has mental problems.\n[collective laughter]\nJit: Yeah, I mean crazy awesome— RJ!: I don't care.\nJit: —I mean the music is just great too, it's like \"Oh, great, this Jit guy, he's got a triangle\"... No, it was like a square doing the bassline and some really sparse electronic... noise drums, and the other square doing the melody. And then the triangle comes in, and it's arpeggios!\nRJ!: Oh my godddd, yes! Jit: Oh, woah!\nRJ!: It's gorgeous, it's simple, but it's gorgeous. Jit: You got this crazy shit right there, I mean, Jesus.\nGFD: It sets itself apart, it is, uh... I don't know what it is.\nJit: Yeah, I think this is like the first thing I ever made in Famitracker too.\nRJ!: I've never made anything in Famitracker, so you're still beating me in that regard.\nGFD: This is still better than the first things I made in Famitracker.\nRJ!: It's...\nNick: Yeah, you tell me, this is like, way better than what I started out with.\nGFD: RJ, haven't you watched my Famitracker tutorial yet?\nRJ!: Haven't had the time, I'm more busy than... I'm busier than God. GFD: It's only... it's only an hour. It's only an hour.\nRJ!: I know, and I'm busier than God as I just said.\nGFD: God has all the time in the world, though. Literally.\nNick: Woah, what the hell was that?\n\n[[track:confrontation|-CONFRONTATION-]]\nGFD: Oh, here we go.\nJit: This is— RJ!: [bad song imitation] Jit: —more Adghar. RJ!: Yeah, definitely.\nNick: So, what is this? GFD: Me and RJ were part, were inspirations for the song, a little bit. You can hear quotes from some of my songs that had never actually been out ever. Uh...\nRJ!: Am I really an inspiration for this, because I was listening to it and I didn't notice.\nGFD: Uh— Nick: Wait, what was the inspiration? GFD: —Andrew H. took like two really, really frickin' old tracks that I made a long time ago.\nRJ!: He said it was Jade inspired and I guess, would that mean that there's some, um... Wait... I'm listening right now... I can't notice any uh, if there's some [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] in here.\nGFD: Isn't it [[track:gardener|Gardener]] that's in here?\nRJ!: That's what [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of So]]—, yeah, yeah. GFD: Wait. I don't know my Homestuck songs very well.\nRJ!: [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] is the original, um, it's the same melody as in [[track:gardener|Gardener]]. [[track:gardener|Gardener]] is just the thing that Steve Everson took and he took mine, and put it to a fake bass sample.\nGFD: Oh.\nRJ!: Yeah... But it's the same melody, the original is [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]], but it's easier to call it [[track:gardener|Gardener]] so just do that. He gave it the name.\nGFD: It was, oh, we skipped over that part already. The minor part back there was inspired by \"eerie.mp3\" if anybody remembers that from me.\nRJ!: I don't.\nGFD: No, nobody does.\nJit: I think I have that in my computer somewhere.\nRJ!: You should give it to me so I can remix it.\nJit: I kind of store everything I ever download Homestuck and I put it in like a, in a folder on my computer.\nRJ!: The [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]] artwork is scaring me. Jit: It's some old stuff and there is that one song that Bowman made for the Crowsprite that never got used.\nGFD: Awh... Anybody remember [[track:mechanic-panic|Mechanic Panic]]?\nRJ!: Yes.\nJit: Yeah, I think I have that one on my computer too— RJ!: That didn't make it onto this album, sadly. [Note: It's actually in the bonus tracks!]\nGFD: I know, it was one of the very first songs that I remember from the forums... when Andrew was like \"Here, make a boss battle song.\"\n\n[[track:rising-water-oh-shit|-RISING WATER (OH, SHIT!)-]]\nNick: What is this?\nRJ!: Here's Slunk [Note: Paige Turner].\nGFD: Ah, yeah. Nick: Oh, Slunk...\nRJ!: [[track:rising-water-oh-shit|Rising Water (Oh, Shit!)]]\nGFD: And unfortunately, we lost the Famitracker files, so we don't have an NSF of this one either. And we cry.\nRJ!: Yeah, this art is really scaring me now.\nGFD: Are you still drawing this? What are you drawing now?\nRJ!: I'm still drawing— [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]]. GFD: Oh. Oh, boy.\nNick: That silly... Oh man, this is a high quality clip.\nRJ!: Isn't it?\nNick: Dude, yeah.\nRJ!: The highest quality.\nNick: I didn't know you could actually mess up the quality on a NSF file.\nJit: Really, what? GFD: What?\nJit: I'm not sure what you're talking about, I'm not versed in... That stuff... Nick: Not like... music quality, I'm talking about sound quality.\nRJ!: Yeah. Jit: Oh.\nNick: But hey, who's complaining?\nJit: Oh god, that frickin' rising water! [shivering noises]\nJit: Oh, dear god. RJ!: Oh, shit!\nGFD: And then there was the glub at the end.\n\n[[track:moment-of-pause|-MOMENT OF PAUSE-]]\nGFD: And now, what's this? What is this track? What IS this track?\nRJ!: This is the pause theme. GFD: Oh, yes, this is the one you made—\nRJ!: While mastering the album. GFD: WHILE you were mastering the album.\nGFD: Yes, while mastering, because you needed a transition.\nRJ!: And it wouldn't work, yeah. GFD: Ya weirdo.\nGFD: Oh well, it's not as bad as me finishing... Eh, actually, no, it is worse than me finishing a song three days before the album, so what am I talking about.\nJit: Hey, I only put up like, my WAVs last night 'cause I was like, \"uhhh, something going on with this?\"\n[collective laughter] Jit: \"Oh, I should get my WAVs then. Here you go.\" GFD: Did you know this was being released today?\nJit: ...No? [collective laughter] Jit: Not really, no. GFD: Man...\nJit: 'Cause Radiation [Note: ...Toby Fox] was like, \"I think I'll hold it off until after the end of acts\" and I was like...\nRJ!: When did he say that?\nJit: He said it on the forums or something.\nGFD: Well... RJ!: Wait, wait.\nJit: As if he was the one who was deciding when it went out too, was weird. GFD: Uh, well...\nRJ!: Yeah, that's kind of... scary.\nGFD: Well, that's not happening anymore.\nJit: Whatever... No, screw him.\nRJ!: He says publicly, for the public record.\n[laughter] Jit: Yeah. Screw [[track:black|Black]] too.\n[laughter] Nick: Yeah, how 'bout that— GFD: Yeh. Nick: —Radiation, or should I say... mmMMMmGAYdiation.\nJit: Does he even have any tracks on this album?\nRJ!: No, he does not have any tra—\n\n[[track:bars|-BARS-]]\nGFD: Oh, here's [[track:bars|Bars]]. Here's [[track:bars|Bars]] coming on.\nRJ!: I made this. Yeah, I made this.\nGFD: Yeah, RJ made this and I helped a little bit, except actually the whole song was me the whole time! You didn't expect that, did you?\nRJ!: Why was that so funny to you? Jit: Was it really all you?\nGFD: I don't know, it's hilarious, okay?\nRJ!: I posted... I'm not even going to explain the joke.\nGFD: Yeah, okay, it's just a joke, okay? Uh, yeah, this was the one I finished three days before this came out. 'Cause I'm like, wait, I have this song idea, I'm gonna make it. I still have two other song ideas that are kind of Jailbreak-y, but I just, I don't have time to do them. So, I'm just going to leave them for something else. Maybe my EP that I still want to make.\nRJ!: Ooh, you should do an EP. GFD: I know. RJ!: I would buy it. GFD: I know. RJ!: I would buy it.\nGFD: It's going to be like yours, five years in the making.\nRJ!: Nice. Except mine's an LP.\nGFD: Oh. Well... Screw you.\nRJ!: Please do.\nGFD: This is my favorite part. Jit: Is this...\nRJ!: Yes. Jit: Is this the same song then? Or...\nRJ!: Yeah, it's got a long pause.\nGFD: Yeah. It's suspenseful, and artistic. I like silence in music.\nJit: That's not artistic—\n\n[[track:jackknive|-JACKKNIVE-]]\nJit: —oh, this is the new song, now.\nNick: The new song.\nJit: I still remember this one, it's not even called \"Jackknife\" on my computer. It's called, uh, what is it... \"idea 6 chiptune\".\nRJ!: Well, it's called \"JackKniVeFe\" on the actual album.\nJit: Yeah, I'm not sure if you actually end it with \"ve\" or \"fe\"— wait, you're not actually calling it that are you?\nGFD: He is. RJ!: No, I am. I am.\nJit: No, nonono no, put it as \"ve\".\nRJ!: No, it's uh... I'm gonna write, read this out to you, letter by letter: \"J-a-c-k-K-n-i-F-e-V-e\".\nJit: But no... [laughter] RJ!: Yes.\nGFD: That's what I told him, don't do that.\nRJ!: Serious— Jit: No... RJ!: N— Yes. Jit: No! No no, you can't do that. That's not your decision.\nRJ!: It isn't my decision? Well, technically, it is my decision, but it isn't my decision. If you really want me to change it, I will. That's what it is right now, though.\nGFD: I think he really wants you to change it.\nJit: Yeah... No, it's just because... I was kinda of typing in all caps last night, so you can't really take... I don't think you should try to be taking anything I said last night in the doc very seriously.\nNick: Oh, we're going to. Don't worry.\nJit: I mean, I was like \"AHH JIT'S HERE. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME COKE WHILE THIS STUFF UPLOADS, YEAH!\"\nRJ!: How HIGH were you?\nJit: I was... I'm never high. I'm just...\nGFD: And then, you deleted my amazing poetry. You jerk.\nJit: That wasn't poetry. GFD: Yes, it was.\nJit: No, it wasn't. GFD: It was quality poetry.\nJit: Was not. [laughter]\nJit: I'll give you a quality poetry: \"Roses are red, violets are blue... GFD is stupid, and so is poo.\" RJ!: \"And fuck you!\"\nNick: Woah!\nJit: No, you can't interrupt. RJ!: I co-opted on your god damn poetry into my own.\nGFD: Shut... Shut.\nNick: I didn't realize this whole album was 42 minutes long.\nGFD: It is. RJ!: You didn't?\nGFD: We're not even halfway. Nick: No. I know...\nRJ!: The scary thing is that half of it is mine, which means I wrote 20 minutes of chiptunes for this album.\nNick: I wrote two. GFD: The other scary thing is that this call has been going for like, two hours, fifteen minutes before we started recording.\nRJ!: Yeeah, that's kinda bad. Jit: Yeeah.\nGFD: Half an hour of that us trying to find us a safe failsafe before recording. Jit: Was not, you're just...\nRJ!: Which we never did. GFD: No. I really hope Vegas doesn't crash.\nJit: I've sorta got one going, but I'm not sure how it's working.\nGFD: What?\nJit: I mean, it's recording the music too. GFD: Oh.\nJit: So I have to have my music kinda low. GFD: Oh.\nRJ!: I just realized I accidentally, like subconsciously drew this elf as Sweet Bro. [laughter]\nRJ!: Oh, no no, it's Hella Jeff. Hella Jeff's the one with the 8^y mouth. Jit: Keep it! Keeeep it.\nRJ!: I'm keeping it, no, don't worry. Jit: Good boy.\n\n[[track:intestinal-fortification|-INTESTINAL FORTIFICATION-]]\nGFD: Okay, wait, what's this one?\nRJ!: Um, uh, this is right after... This is [[track:intestinal-fortification|Intestinal Fortification]]. This is also Slunk.\nGFD: Oh, this is also Slunk. Another one we don't have an NSF for. Oh, that percussion's nice.\nNick: I like it. RJ!: I like it.\nGFD: This is the song that represents all the blood, and mud, and... stuff.\nNick: Woaah...\nJit: And all the poo [unintelligible]. RJ!: This has a genuinely terrifying art that he did for it.\nNick: But... huh...\nRJ!: Because, for his art, um, for the album art he did for his own tracks, or her own tracks, her/his, he uh, she, um... The art Slunk did for the tracks is really like hyper-realistic. I mean, not hyper-realistic, but like, these scary realistic renditions of the Jailbreak characters doing the same actions.\nJit: What do you mean hyper-realistic? RJ!: Not hyper— Well...\nJit: I don't think I've actually seen... RJ!: It's not actually hyper-realistic— GFD: Now we're halfway.\nRJ!: —it's actually kind of cartoon-y. GFD: We hit halfway.\nRJ!: But, it's um... Relative to the stick figures in the actual comic, it's realistic, and it's terrifying.\nGFD: Then [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]] was amazing.\nRJ!: It's like nightmare, nightmare-ish. It's yeah, then [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], uh um, [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]] is, [blubbering] It's good.\nJit: I don't think—\nRJ!: I'll agree with that.\nGFD: I still know how this song goes, even though I haven't heard it in ages. It is— Nick: Very memorable. GFD: —it is that. RJ!: It is. GFD: Yes, it is memorable.\nRJ!: I like both of Slunk's tracks here a lot, in a completely different way from the rest of the album.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: They're both really, um... I don't know how to descri— I don't know an adjective that's perfect for it.\nGFD: Slunk-y.\nRJ!: That's perfect.\nGFD: Exactly. And it's over.\n\n[[track:console-thunder|-CONSOLE THUNDER-]]\nGFD: And now, this is the stereo track. He made this one in— RJ!: Stere—\nJit: Yeah, I just, I so suddenly noticed that.\nGFD: Yeah, because RJ is... suddenly, this one's on a Game Boy... or something.\nNick: Heh.\nJit: Did Game Boy's have ste— GFD: They did! They had stereo, uh, sound. RJ!: Well—\nJit: I could never notice that 'cause, uh...\nGFD: Yeah, the speaker had stereo sound. RJ!: They did have stereo sound. They in fact, it's advertised as such on them. Like, the Game Boy itself.\nGFD: Yeah. Dot matrix with stereo sound. RJ!: As having stereo sound. Yep! ...but yeah, I cha—\nJit: How do you remember those things about a Game Boy, like were you playing games on them or were you just studying the manuals in games.\nRJ!: It says that on the Game Boy itself. GFD: Right under the screen. Or above it. RJ!: Yeah, literally. GFD: Yeah.\nJit: Well, shut...\nGFD: So, you can't really avoid that one.\nJit: [mocking noises] Yeah, you can if you're me.\nRJ!: Clearly. GFD: Well, you're a dingus.\nNick: Woah... Jit: I'm not a dingus! Nick: Are you going to take that back? That's not nice.\nGFD: No.\nRJ!: Never call somebody a genius to their face.\nGFD: No, I said dingus.\nRJ!: You called someone a genius to their Skype.\nJit: He said dingus.\nRJ!: I don't care. [laughter]\nJit: Oh, I just found a battery!\nNick: Woah. Jit: Thrilling commentary by Jit. I'm sorry, I'm just like, \"Oh, woah, a battery.\"\nRJ!: Let's talk about batteries for a while.\nGFD: No! Jit: It's those little ones that you stick into laser pointers and Tamagotchis.\nRJ!: For a lot of this album, I cheated because I'm mixing very different kinds of soundchips together. They're all 8-bit, but I have a Sega PSG here, along with a Nintendo emulation and a Game Boy emulation, like there's a bunch of different things for a lot of them.\nGFD: Strange. I like the stereo sound here, even though it's not... uh... Jit: It's not appropriate.\nNick: It's not Kosher.\nJit: RJ, you're not supposed to be showing that sort of stereo graphic sound in here.\nGFD: It's not straight-bit, that's the phrase I'm stealing from RJ. RJ!: I like... I liked yeah, how nobody said that about Phantom Echoes even though that was stereo too.\nGFD: It was stereo? Nick: But that one was cooler.\nGFD: It wasn't as... RJ!: [fake laughter] Yeah, it was. Actually, though, it is cooler than this one.\nGFD: It wasn't dramatic about its stereo. It wasn't throwing it in your face. RJ!: That's true, all of my stereo tracks are very stereo.\nGFD: Yes. [imitating song]\nRJ!: Is it enervating yet?\nJit: I don't know... What's enervating mean?\nRJ!: Irritating, but um, yeah. Jit: Oh, no. You can never be irritating.\nRJ!: I'm irritating, I'm pretty irritating.\nGFD: RJ is fucking annoying!\nRJ!: It's true. GFD: But fucking irritating as what your Skype used to be.\nRJ!: Yeah. GFD: But now, you're a gigantic fucking eye and fuck.\nRJ!: For everyone who has added me on Skype, they already know that, but it's true.\nGFD: Yes.\nJit: Awshi... Sorry, I dropped something. GFD: Because of the one time I went to chat you, and then your display picture was a gigantic eye and that's what I said: \"a gigantic fucking eye and fuck.\"\nRJ!: I actually... I know. GFD: Because it scared the crap out of me, okay? That thing was huge.\nRJ!: It's just a—\n\n[[track:be-the-other-guy|-BE THE OTHER GUY-]]\nJit: —okay, wait, I don't remember this one, what is this?\nRJ!: Uh, this is \"With Bros\".\nGFD: Is it still going to be called that? Nick: \"With Bros\".\nRJ!: Probab— Jit: Ohh, PerryBob [Note: Perry Sullivan].\nGFD: He says [unintelligible] change the title. RJ!: Probably... I can change the title and I probably will, it was originally \"With Friends\", that's most likely what it's going to be but... I don't know.\nGFD: It's going to be \"With Friends\" again?\nRJ!: \"With Friends Again\", that's actually... No no, wait... I don't know.\nNick: How about \"[[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]\"? Jit: Man, you know, I wish [[track:mannequin|Mannequin]] was on this album.\nRJ!: [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]] is actually a perfect title.\nGFD: [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The]]— Jit: Actually, now that I'm suddenly thinking about it, [[track:mannequin|Mannequin]] should be on this album.\nRJ!: Well, you can't change that now because the track list has already been mastered and finalized.\nGFD: Hah! Jit: Yeah, I know. GFD: Hah.\nRJ!: And we're commenting on it.\nJit: I am the master of being late, I've noticed this recently like, someone will tell me to do something or I'll be like \"Oh, I should do this thing for someone\" and then I won't get to it for months and months.\nGFD: Ha, yeah, how lo— how old is that Jailbake thread that I made in the music enclave now?\nRJ!: Probab— GFD: Which is still [intelligible] that you guys used apparently.\nRJ!: Well, uh, I don't know how exactly how old it is, but a good metric is the fact that Andrew said that we were probably going to be releasing this album sometime in July. [laughter]\nGFD: Oh, good times...\nJit: Yeah, really.\nGFD: This is so catchy.\nJit: Oh, for some reason, I'm just like, looking through my desk while we talk. I don't know why.\nRJ!: Multitasking! [song imitation noises]\nJit: Not really. Maybe it's just like a natural part of the... [song imitation noises]\nGFD: I like this song.\nJit: What?\nRJ!: I do too.\nJit: I like lots of stuff that PerryBob does.\nRJ!: PerryBob and Tyler Deververver... Dedever... the Dever [Note: James Dever].\nJit: Dever?\nRJ!: Mister Sburb.\nGFD: Jit, I don't actually know how to pronounce your last name.\nRJ!: Scheele.\nGFD: Scheele?\nJit: What? Yeah, yeah, it's Scheele.\nGFD: Interesting.\nRJ!: But yeah, um... Jit: It's German, it's does—\nGFD: That's not even a pronoun— Nick: Is it still [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]?\nGFD: This isn't, that's not even a pronounciation that I imagined while thinking about the ones it could be. Nick: I'm just going to assume this is still \"[[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]\".\nJit: What, were you thinking it was like \"Ski-lee\" or something?\nGFD [unintelligible] \"Skeel\". RJ!: Have we decided then, this track is now called [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]] then? I like that.\nGFD: Okay. I thought it was like \"Sch-keele\" or something.\nNick: Scheele. It's German.\nGFD: Fine. You're German?\nJit: At least it's... Uh... I don't actually know.\nNick: The name is German. Jit: I think I'm more of Dutch nowadays, but old German.\nGFD: Interesting.\nJit: Like, the name is definitely German, but I think my grandfather is Dutch.\nGFD: Can you swear at us in German?\nJit: Uh... I don't think so. GFD: Aw...\nJit: I don't actually know much German at all, I'd like repeating lines from TF2 or something. [laughter]\nNick: [bad Heavy imitation] \"Go ahead and cry, baby!\"\nRJ!: Yeah, Jesus Christ Superstar, this is scary art. Jit: That's a Heavy [unintelligible].\nRJ!: What am I doing?\nGFD: RJ, what are you doing?\nJit: Hey, Jesus Christ Superstar is... RJ!: No, I'm saying the Elf Shanty art is really terrifying.\nGFD: Okay, uh... Nick: It should be.\nJit: Yeah, the elves are terrifying in Jailbreak, they aren't like the nice ones in Problem Sleuth. These ones are like \"Hey, you want our help?\" \"Take this as a warning, and go away.\"\nRJ!: No, I'm just saying I made this elf look kind of like Venom from Spider-Man. [laughter]\nGFD: What? Jit: Oh, nice. I like that idea. GFD: No, I don't know how you did that, I'm trying to imagine this piece of art and I can't do it. My brain doesn't work that way.\nRJ!: It's the tongue. Jit: It's probably an elf with the— RJ!: It has the Venom tongue.\nJit: Yeah.\n\n[[track:softbit|-SOFTBIT-]]\nGFD: Wait, what song is this? I've never heard this.\nRJ!: This is [[track:softbit|Softbit]].\nGFD: This is [[track:softbit|Softbit]]?!\nRJ!: Yeeah, man. Nick: [unintelligible] RJ!: I completely rechanged it, reworked it, whatever. Words.\nGFD: Holy crap! This is really... this sounds like something from Cave Story now!\nGFD: It IS from Cave Story, you just took a song from Cave Story and stuck it in the album, you jerk. Nick: I like it a lot.\nRJ!: Yeah, I did, I'm sorry. Nick: Yeah, good job, now we can't sell this.\nRJ!: Copyright Studio Pixekel. It's not like we haven't done that before. Nick: Pixekel? GFD: Pixel.\nRJ!: Pik, Pick, Pic Skull. Nick: No, don't say it, don't say it.\nJit: Is this really from Cave Story?\nGFD: No, it's not. RJ!: No, it's not actually from Cave Story. Jit: Okay, good.\nGFD: Just like RJ actually made [[track:bars|Bars]]. [laughter] Oh, wait... Man, it's missing all the oomph that it used to have. It's all uh—\nRJ!: It's more...  Nick: YOU'RE missing the oomph. RJ!: Softer than—\nGFD: It's wimpier.\nNick: You're wimpier.\nRJ!: It's softer.\nJit: Wait... this melody sounds familiar GFD: It does. RJ!: I wonder, is it because I wrote it?\n[laughter] GFD: Why did you redo this song?\nRJ!: I didn't like it before. GFD: Can you upload the old version as a bonus track, 'cause I liked it that way.\nRJ!: OOOOKAY... GFD: Okay. Nick: No! GFD: Yes.\nRJ!: But only because, I'm gonna call it: \"[[track:softbit-original-gfd-please-shut-the-fuckass-mix-by-request-demo-version|Softbit (GFD's Surprise Mix)]]\". [laughter]\nNick: \"[[track:softbit-original-gfd-please-shut-the-fuckass-mix-by-request-demo-version|Softbit (This is Why I Changed it Remix)]]\". [laughter]\nGFD: Excellent.\nJit: I swear this sounds familiar, like it's a Homestuck track.\nRJ!: Because it is a Homestuck track!\nGFD: It is, it's the...\nRJ!: It's, uh, it's a rearrangement of [[track:softly|Softly]] from Volume 5 that I wrote.\nJit: Oh, okay... I hardly remember that track, unfortunately.\nRJ!: It's okay, most people don't remember my songs. [fake sniffles]\nJit: I doubt most people remember my songs either, but I mean, Volume 5 was massive.\nGFD: I doubt anybody LISTENED to my songs.\nNick: People listened to my song on Volume 5.\n[song imitation noises]\nGFD: No, you know what, nono, no, this is, like, this is one... The difference between your old version of this song and the new one is like, the old Cave Story soundtrack to the new one on WiiWare. That's the difference.\nRJ!: That was mean. You're mean. You're being mean to me.\nGFD: It, it's, it's, it is, that is how it sounds like, even some of the instruments sound the same.\nJit: Wait, are you saying this one's the new one or?\nGFD: The new one.\nJit: Oh... you're mean. GFD And.— RJ!: That was mean.\nJit: I don't even know what the new soundtrack is, but, I mean...\nGFD: It's okay.\nJit: It's like thinking about the new Spelunky soundtrack or something because I played the original and I played this great mod of it called \"Tastes Like Spelunky\". And then it's like, oh, there's a new one! And I'm like, oh great, will Buzinkai do the music? [growling] Nooo.\nGFD: What just happened to your voice?\nNick: [imitating growl] Nooo. GFD: It sounded really scary on this end.\nRJ!: It sounded like when I used effects with DigiTech, with my DigiTech vocalist.\nJit: That's just me, going all deep in voice for some—\n[everyone imitating growl] [laughter]\nJit: 'Cause I mean. Oh, I dunno. I get this feeling that I don't actually know how high my voice is normally, but I can go pretty low.. 'cause I'm like, a bass, in choir speak.\nGFD: My voice. My voice is just weird, I hate it.\nJit: Yeah, I hate my voice too. I tried to record some singing the other day—\n\n[[track:drillgorg|-DRILLGORG-]]\nNick: Yes. GFD: Yes, here we go. Jit: Oh man, I love this, [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], yes! RJ!: Me too! Me too. GFD: Woo! This is all me!\nRJ!: We're in the ending stretch of the album, right now. This is good. Jit: Are we?\nGFD: TSN [Note: Nick Smalley] helped with instrumentation on this one.\nNick: And volumes. Good lord, the volumes.\nGFD: Yeah, 'cause the percussion was kind of overpowering before.\nJit: Oh man, this one's [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]].\nGFD: Yes, yeah it is. Jit: I even remember the title, yes. RJ!: Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. I love this one.\nGFD: TSN also had the idea for the lovely DPCM samples.\nRJ!: That's perfect by the way, don't change a thing. GFD: I know.\nJit: I don't even know what that is.\nNick: Oh, the changing the echo?\nGFD: Oh, Jit, you haven't heard the voices in this one yet?\nJit: No... what? GFD: Well, let's— RJ!: Um— GFD: We had to—\nGFD: Hold on, everyone be quiet, it's coming up right now. [shush] RJ!: Okay. GFD: Let him hear it.\n[lyrics kick in] Jit: Oh, yeah, I know this one. GFD: Oh.\nRJ!: The atypical thing about this album is that, for the first time I think, the one who's not shoehorning voice samples in the album is not me. [laughter]\nJit: Hey, you do good things with voice samples though.\nNick: Shut up!\nJit: Well, let's see, who does shoehorn voice samples in? There's RJ, Bowman I guess, I can think of Radiation...\nGFD: [[track:mayor-maynot|Mayor Maynot]]?\nRJ!: Boner boner bo-bo bo-boner boner!\nNick: Yeah, that was cute. Jit: Yeah and also [[track:gaia-queen|Gaia Queen]], uhh, and then, [unintelligible].\n\n[[track:retrobution|-RETROBUTION-]]\nGFD: Guys! Guys, [[track:retrobution|Retrobution]]!\nNick: Yes!\nJit: Oh, man, the other great one!\nNick: It's the good one.\nRJ!: Fucking hell that melody, Jesus Christ.\nGFD: I helped TSN on this one, this time. A little bit of instrumentation, mostly the ending.\nNick: Mostly the ending.\nRJ!: Nick Smalley on a Game Boy.\nNick: That's me.\n[imitating song]\nJit: I can't even do cool stuff like this one anymore.\nNick: I was heading up— Jit: Did you make this in Famitracker?\nNick: Yeah, I made this in Famitracker.\nJit: Sweeeet.\nRJ!: It's soooo pretty.\nNick: Really?\nRJ!: You're pretty.\nNick: Oh, thanks. That's flattering.\n[laughter] Jit: You're all pretty people.\nGFD: Ah... except, except me. Jit: Pretty ponies and people.\nNick: I like how it slows down, it's my favorite part. Just this break.\nJit: Yeah, I've never been really dramatic like that with my stuff. I don't know, maybe I should try that out sometime.\nGFD: My favorite part is the ending. 'Cause I made it. RJ!: My favorite part is the whooole fuckiiing sooong.\nJit: My favorite part is the arpeggios at the beginning...\nGFD: Arpeggios! [imitating song]\nGFD: You just have to say arpeggios a lot. Jit: Yeah...\nRJ!: Arpeggios, arpeggi— d-yeah, I can't do that.\n[imitating song] RJ!: That works, that works. That's cheating, though.\nNick: I know.\nGFD: Here it comes. Oh wait, this is near the end. The climax of the song.\nRJ!: Kick drum.\nGFD: It's all bass heavy.\nNick: I like that.\nRJ!: Me too.\nNick: Heavy percussion is the best part.\nGFD: It was, it is DPCM percussion isn't it?\nNick: Yeah. GFD: Yeeaahh. That's good stuff.\nRJ!: I wonder how AgentParsec will feel about this Elf Shanty artwork.\nGFD: From here on, is where I help make the ending. Nick: I like the ending.\nGFD: It used to be such a cop-out ending.\nNick: Yeah, it was. [laughter]\nJit: What, was it a fade out or something?\nGFD: It used to, it would just do another slowdown and just sorta ended, but now it's this.\nRJ!: Yeah, but now it's awesome.\n[\"your mother\" part of \"retrobution\" plays]\n[collective laughter] Jit: Ahaha, what?\n\n[[track:game-over-jailbreak|-GAME OVER-]]\nJit: I don't remember the \"your mother\" part.\nNick: That's the best part.\nGFD: I just stuck it in at the end there and then TSN stretched it out hilariously.\n[laughter]\nJit: Yoouurr mootthherr.\nGFD: RJ, are you seriously going to do [[track:a-common-occurrance-every-night-to-be-exact|a bonus track]] by remixing the...?\nRJ!: Yeah, yeah I am.\n[laughter]\nGFD: You're hilarious.\nRJ!: Thank you, thank...\n\n[[track:is-this-the-end|-IS THIS THE END?-]]\nRJ!: I'm also planning on incorporating \"Your Bed\", the Bowman video.\nGFD: Yes, please.\nJit: Wait, the one, the \"IN HELL\" one or...\nRJ!: No, no no no. GFD: No.\nNick: \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\"\nGFD: No, not my YouTube Poop, it's the \"Your Bed\" video.\nJit: Ohh, the actual...\nGFD: Yes. RJ!: Yeah.\nGFD: Not one of my remixes. RJ!: By Bowman, yeah.\nGFD: I should finish my other one.\nJit: So what track is this? I recognize it, but I'm not sure.\nRJ!: Are you doing that on purpose? This is \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\"\nGFD: RJ, you changed this track again!\nRJ!: I just said, I said that too.\nJit: This track, \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\", this is the last track?\nRJ!: No, the last track is \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\".\nJit: Oh, you cheeky bastard.\nGFD: There's more stereo here.\nRJ!: There is, yeah.\nGFD: RJ. RJ!: So, from... Jit: [unintelligible]\nRJ!: What? Nick: Woah... GFD: What?\nGFD: I hate it when we all try to talk at the same time, and then nothing happens. Somebody say something.\nRJ!: Oh. Jit: Yeah.\nRJ!: Hi. My name is RJ. I made this track. I hope you like it.\nGFD: I helped.\nJit: Did you do anything special with this track?\nRJ!: Um, I... Stereo.\nJit: Why am I hearing samples that sound like someone going \"pschwoo\" or like, this sucking-in sound that's also expectorating and I'm not sure—\nRJ!: That's the, um... It's an NES noise channel with a negative, like... I don't know, what do you call it?\nGFD: This sounds different too.\nRJ!: Pitch. It's less crowded so it's much easier to listen to and not painful.\nJit: You know, it's funny nowadays, because you can almost like... The two tracks, [[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End]] and \"[[track:this-is-the-end|The End]]\", it's almost like Jailbreak is, or how it was. Because for the longest time, it just ended.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's true. Jit: With the horse going in and going to sleep. But then we actually had a legitimate end when Andrew linked to it.\nGFD: That is kinda funny, I never noticed that.\nJit: Yeah, so now it's like, oh, \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\" that's pre-updated and then, \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\", oh, the horse is going to sleep, okay. Nick: Oh.\nGFD: Zero score. I tried to click \"Do you want to play again?\" and then nothing happened, and I was sad.\nGFD: RJ.\nRJ!: Yeah.\nGFD: Aren't you so glad that I stayed up playing Doom and sent you a million voicemails to wake you up while you were fell asleep producing.\nRJ!: Yes, yes I am, actually.\n[laughter]\nJit: I wish I could do that to you. Just have your phone number and pester you.\nGFD: I just called him via Gmail and then—\nRJ!: You can have my phone number if you want it. It's not— GFD: It's in the— Jit: Wait, you can call people via Gmail?\nGFD: Yeah, you can set do free calls to the US and Canada.\nJit: Oh my god, really?\n[collective laughter]\nJit: I am so excited by this possibility.\nGFD: I'm trying to call Bowman but he never answers. RJ!: I'm gonna put tiny... I'm putting tiny stars inside of the elf's eyes.\nGFD: This track's pretty loud, for some reason. It just feels louder.\nRJ!: Really?\nGFD: Yeah, I don't know.\nRJ!: I can turn it down before the album goes out?\nGFD: Are you sure you're done mastering?\nRJ!: I am done mastering but like, I mean, individual tracks can be... still played with a little bit.\nJit: Oh, listen to that filter!\n\n[[track:this-is-the-end|-THIS IS THE END-]]\nJit: And now, \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\". Nick: [[track:is-this-the-end|Is this the end?]]\nRJ!: \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\".\nGFD: It's overrrr! Jit: This is really stereo.\nNick: That was good comments.\nGFD: I wonder if anybody's going to get the joke in Drillgorg.\nRJ!: I will drill your ass... GFD: Like how I will drill your ass is uh...\nJit: Oh my god, I suddenly get it! It's a reference to \"Rosenblatt\".\nGFD: Yes, it's a reference to \"Rosenblatt\".\nJit: Oh... BroHoster, what a great thing that is nowadays.\nNick: Yeah, that's why I put it there. Jit: Just to have...\nGFD: It's one of my favorite YTPMVs I've made. Jit: Wow.\nGFD: I should just make an album of YTMPVs or something. Nick: [loud bumps] Ahh! GFD: TSN, what did you just do?\nNick: I killed myself.\n[laughter]\nNick: There you have it, top notch quality commentating.\nRJ!: Is this still too loud, by the way? Like, compared to the other one?\nGFD: No, it's not.\nRJ!: Ok, good. So maybe I'll just have to fix the other one then if it's painfully loud.\nGFD: I like how we're doing the commentary, but we're still doing stuff for the album.\nRJ!: Well, it's because the album's not completely out yet.\nGFD: This is a really great release. RJ, how much sleep have you had working on this?\nRJ!: Uh, one and a half hours.\nGFD: My goodness gracious, no wonder your eye is so... RJ!: I'm to— I'm totally awake right now, actually. It's kind of incredible. I feel amazing.\nGFD: You are an incredible machine, but— RJ!: I am a machine.\nGFD: Let us all give thanks to RJ and his album that also a couple of other people helped with a little bit.\nRJ!: That sounds more like my— oh wait, I can't talk about what album I was just gonna talk about.\n[exaggerated gasping]\nNick: He must be some cool kid, trying to— RJ!: [sarcastic laughter] Yeah, I am. GFD: Such a cool kid.\nRJ!: I'm the coolest. Nick: RJ's really cool kid. He should have an album.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: I should.\nJit: Yeah, everyone should have an album. Nick: RJ should have a cool kid album.\nJit: Nick Smalley, you should have an album.\nRJ!: He's a pretty cool kid, too.\nGFD: Yeah. Me and Nick should make one. RJ!: The coolest. I'M THE COOLEST!\nNick: Let's all make an album. RJ!: What is that from? Wh-wh-wh— Oh, no, that's Sonic the Hedgehog, isn't that?\nJit: Haha, what? Nick: Yeah.\nRJ!: Yeah, that's Sonic the Hedgehog.\nJit: I'm not gonna have this... wait, is it done?\nNick: Yeah. Jit: No, it's not done yet!\nNick: That's— that's it!\nRJ!: That was the end of the album.\nGFD: It's overrrrrrrr!\nRJ!: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep! It's over!\nNick: That was commentation...\nRJ!: That was commentary on [[album:jailbreak-vol-1|Jailbreak Vol. 1]], by Jailbreak.\nGFD: You're welcome.\nRJ!: I hope you enjoyed it. Nick: [deep voice] I hope you enjoyed it.\nJit: Yeah, next time it updates, we'll make a Volume 2 all about that one update.\n[collective laughter]—",

Don't try to tell me otherwise\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before <br>You see a thousand of me (thousand of me) and this is what we're made for\nFrom now on I know I'll be more careful where I tread <br>I'm alive, I'm smiling, I'm so tired of being dead\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before (The time will come when you'll see)<br>You see I'm far from empty, I'm back to what I live for (What lies in your destiny)\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before (The time will come when you'll see)<br>You see I'm far from empty, I'm back to what I live for (All of your predestiny)",

Do you want me to say sorry?<br>Should I apologize when you ignore me?<br>I didn't ask to be right or to be lonely<br>or to be hatched into an ugly story\nI am a prince and I had a pair of princesses in two sharp squares<br>but then I guess I bored them both to death<br>And now I think my calling is to break apart and fall to pieces<br>Better yet, invent a brand new method of ascension\nI'm impressed, you've managed to survive<br>but rest assured we'd all be better off dead than alive<br>cause when they get ahold of us, we'll all be batter fried<br>and I'm surprised that nobody's considered switching sides\nSo here I am, respectfully and royally destroying<br>any chance of getting back on your good gills<br>And I don't mean to be hurtful, but if yellow's the new purple<br>Well, then bleeding's the new breathing, don't you think I will!\nI used to wish the death of every living thing<br>I might be your killer but you'd never be my queen<br>so put away your laughter, pack up your hopes and dreams<br>I'm done with black back-handing and red pandering, it seems\nThat I am just pathetic, I won't be overlooked!<br>I'm past the point of fishing to get back upon your hook!<br>I've made a manifesto, I've been bested by a crook! But never more!<br>I'm planning on reclaiming what he took...\nSo what? Do you want me to say sorry?<br>Should I apologize when you ignore me?<br>I didn't ask to be right or to be lonely<br>or to be hatched into an ugly story<br>to be hatched into an ugly story\nOh my, this pantomine is getting gory\nI am a prince and I live in a ship<br>I am a prince and I live in a ship",

I’m a heartsick fool.\nStill the fool without a calling, still a fucking fool.",

Where are you?\nWell, this could be the one\nSo I guess I always knew\nI HAVE A PLAN\n\nReading the words behind my eyes\nGuided by promises, some future prize\nGiving control to what you hear\nBehind your ears, behind your ears\n\nThe wind that has been whipping\nHas been changing the way\nThe birds are flying\n\nThe direction that we're taking\nWe've been faking to the point\nOf just denying\n\nWell, we're early in the stream\nLet it flow, let it flow\nIf you're clinging to a dream\nLet it go, let it go\nFor the one that follows you\nYou will know, you will know\nI HAVE A PLAN",

Was this always?\nI was certain, I was wrong\nNow so clear, definitions\nPlainly written all along\n\nEbbs and flows so resounding\nWaves are pounding in my ears\nI can feel what you're proving\nI am moving, I can hear\nAll the WORDS\n\nAll my life, I've known the WORDS\nBut never knew the way to really use them\nSpeak to only what you've heard\nThe WORDS are there, and you are passing through them\n\nKid myself I had control\nBut I was part of something whole\nOr broken, how I let it get away\nTalking like I'm in a mirror\nI would have to learn to hear\nOr nothing would be there for me to say\nWhat could I say? (TALK)\nWhat could I say? (TALK)\nWhat could I say? (TALK)\nWhat could I say?\n\nSay it now, there's your answer\nIn the questions you have asked\nListen close, know you're welcome\nLet these moments truly last\nThis is more than an echo\nThis is feeling, this is touch\nUse your voice, make it clear now.\nYou are here, now fall into hush",

Where the shop should be, there is a beehive, and where there should be a shopkeeper, there is a bee. You approach the bee. He looks up with a menacing pincer snick. You're lost, you explain. You wonder if the bee could direct you to the lemonade. Sweet, sweet lemonade.)\n(Ahh...)\n(The bee looks at you. His mandibles widen. He begins to emit a swarm of yet smaller bees. They surround you, coating your clothes and hair, and infesting your various orifices with their warm, fuzzy mass. Don't worry, says one of the bees, whispering softly into your ear.)\n(Don't worry.)\n(There is nothing to fear. We are merely bees and bees are your friends.)\n(Don't bee afraid.)\n(You don't understand. All you wanted was some lemonade, its sweet icy coolness.)\n(Ahh...)\n(But now, that life is gone, and the whole world is bees. They are coating the room now.)\n(Don't fight it.)\n(They cover everything, filling it, filling you, with bee. Join us, they say, their voices a chorus of mournful buzzing. The soft cadence of the noise seems to hang poised in the air, forcefully penetrating your ears, your skull, your mind.)\n(Join us.)\n(Join us, say the bees, and you realise, you're one with the bees. This skin, this shell, is nothing but a minor barrier between you and the bees. You are bees. Glorious crescendo of buzzing rises under your skin! You are a swarm, rapturous melding of mind and form of bees dissolving to the sound in the air, a choir become one with its music, a phoenix of bees risen to take on a greater yet higher form! You let yourself go. You become one with the bees. You are a bee.)",

That young man's name was Cronus Ampora, and one day he was driving his car, otherwise cruising and bruising, without wearing a seatbelt as mandated by Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. In just a short time, through a series of trials and tribulations that would affect him on this day, he would discover the secrets of seatbelt safety, and have a convertive and serious motor vehicle accident because he was unfastened within the vehicle. This is the story of that journey of self-discovery that would affect him for the rest of his life. All of you, I hope you enjoy.)\n\n(Oh no, not the bees, not the bees! AAAAAAH!)",

    "lyrics": "I'm THINKING of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? The number I’m thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It’s between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that’s between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It’s my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty, and that it’s between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it? It’s a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and get it? I’m thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I’m thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I’m thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don’t grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I’m thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I’m THINKING of a number...",

She really only has [[Gardener]] and [[track:dissension-original|Dissension]], the two songs you just heard. To take those, remix them into a workable song, add my own stuff, and then deliberately make it sound shitty to fit in with the rest of the Cool and New Web Comic... That, I, that's not really an excuse, other musicians have done far more with far less... the rest of this album is proof enough of that.\n\nI guess what it comes down to, is that... I'm not just not as good of a musician, or, really, artist of any way. I don't have talent. I think Hussie said something like \"it actually takes a large amount of skill to get Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff to the perfect amount of shittiness\"... and I don't have the drive or talent or skill to do that, or really anything.\n\nI mean... I did take piano composition classes through middle school but... I haven't done anything since then so... it's almost as if I'd done nothing. And here I am in the middle of a team of people who are actually... putting effort into making good — if difficult to listen to — music, and... I'm left wondering exactly what I can bring to the table.\n\n...Nothing, really. I've thought long and hard about it, and... that's my answer. Nothing. I guess there's only one thing left to do.\n\n\"To: Cool and New Web Comic Music Team. Subject: Resignation. Body: I regret to inform you that I will no longer be creating music with all of you. Good luck in the future, I'm out.\" Guess I'm really doing this, huh?\n\nSend.)",

This evening as we continue to discuss Catholicism, Catholicism, Catholicism.)\n\n(Uh there's— there's a few different things we're going to look at and— that is not a misprint uh this, this is a different fill-in from, uh, the last one that kind of looked like this it's— it's just uh just modified there's more information, new information. Y'know before we go into this in terms of talking about Catholicism, lemme just give you guys just a little update about how everything went on Sunday. As we had our church launch for FloodGate East over at Madison Heights and uh, we gathered there at 6 o'clock and and, yeah. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. There's a balcony.)\n\n(There's a balcony. There's a balcony. And, it was jammed. There... we could have squeezed a few more people in. There's a balcony. There's a balcony. I-it was is-is-isn't that right?) (Yeah.) (It was pretty packed, wasn't it? Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Oh, so— it is a good thing there was a balcony or we would have been turning people away. You know how we keep parking on the lawn out here and, we ru— the lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here. Lawn out here and, we ru— we ran out of parking space here. We ran out of parking space there, every single parking spot was taken, people were parking on the lawn. It's— [laughter]. It's— [laughter]. It's— [laughter].) (It's time to move.) (It's already time to move! [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] There's the balcony. [laughter] There's the balcony. Yeah [laughter].) (Maybe we need to open a new church.) ([laughter] Yeah. I-it was uh, it-it was really crazy and, and, y'know ju— the anointing was powerful. Y'know the, the aspect of the people and all that, the amount of people that showed up was really cool, but the anointing was just off the chart. I-it was so good, uh, for an inaugural... opening night, uhm, just it wa-it was powerful, I don't know what else to say. The anointing was sweet and thick and uhm, [laughter]. There's the balcony. [laughter] Fun. It wa-it— and people were asking \"Is this how FloodGate is normally?\" and uh, and, and, people were, the people who were there from here— so we had about twenty people from here show up. Wou-wou-would you say that about twenty people? Maybe twenty-five? Yeah. But i-but there I m-there was— there was decent repre— representation. Lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving.)\n\n(There's a balcony. Alright let's talk about Catholicism. There- there's so much about the Catholic Church that is, really is fascinating. The-it's a-it's a, interesting thing to study. They reach, they teach many orthodox things and then they teach so many non-orthodox doctrine. The relevant problem relates to— the relevant problem relates to forward. Now [clears throat] [clears throat] [clears throat] [coughs]. Within... the Catholic Church, there are multiple things that shape who they are, what they are, how they— [clears throat] [coughs]. Following the Pope, and— and by the way, the, the, uh, the top offices minus the priests are all considered bishops. Underneath him— lot of sweaty bodies dancing and moving and grooving. Underneath him would come the council of lot of sweaty bodies uh, not retracting. Most of us are like that, we're competitive, we like to do well, and, in terms of the- the priesthood, y'know-there-there are numerous things [clears throat]. Help us to be administrators of truth and help us to help people come out of darkness. We bless you and we thank you my God for your goodness and your grace and your mercy in Jesus name, amen.)\n\n(Please free to use anything you find appropriate on this site, as we have been given great gifts freely from our LORD.

While I personally don't enjoy the content, you aren't breaking any rules, so my qualms are irrelevant.\n\nThat being said, I do feel like there's a bit of an issue when I check /r/homestuck and I'm met with pages of posts by mindbleach or SuicidalSushi, with occasional breaks to show a post by someone else. You guys are obviously new-ish to this subreddit, so I'll explain you a thing. /r/Homestuck has always operated with discussion posts, communitystuck, and other such self-posts. These are now being absolutely <i>buried</i> by the nigh hourly posted links to \"neat homestuck comix and art\" \n\nClearly I'm in the minority here when I say this, judging from the upvotes you guys suck from lurkers. Though perhaps you will listen to an important figure here. (Note how I pretend that being important means I post comments here sometimes and more than 10 people know I exist.) I'm not asking you to stop, It's nice to have more posts, I just don't want it blotting out the discussion and more community-esque posts. Homestuck brought me to the sub, the community made me stay. This is true for many of us here, even if such a statement seems alien to veteran Redditors outside of /r/homestuck.)",

Three faces with \"don't forget\" written on it? It's Ness trying to remember his three friends. In short, Undertale is a continuation of Toby's version of EarthBound, with Ness never being able to get home, adopting the name Sans, and accompanied by Papyrus; a former Starman, an alien force able to speak English and still equipped with his armor and signature posture, but without any knowledge of earthly things, like the sun. The pieces all just seem to fit. Now all we need is an appearance from Pokey/Porky and we've got ourselves a true sequel! But hey, that's just a theory...\n\nA GAME THEORY! THANKS FOR WATCHING!)",

The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? The number I’m thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It’s between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that’s between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It’s my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty, and that it’s between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it? It’s a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and get it? I’m thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I’m thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I’m thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don’t grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I’m thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty.

Riding that Pebble train!)\nCity-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties\nImagine how they will react with glee\nAs the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty\nOf soybean oil and red dye number three\n\nOh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning\nFor the turning of the powers yet to be\nAnd presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning\nAs we cast their ivory towers to the sea\n\nAnd the creatures of the forest hark\nTo Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nNoble stag and yellow lark\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThe innocence of children's eyes\nAnd Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nWill watch that Fruity flag rise\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nUnited we shall march along\nWith Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nSome shall die but we'll fight on\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThe fife shall play its soaring note\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nWe'll slit every dissenting throat\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nThis vow for glory we must keep\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThough God himself may turn and weep\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nDo not fear the cleansing flood\nOf Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nA breakfast table stained with blood\nAnd Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles",

GAME ATTACK!\nWhen I'm on the scoreboard, you sure can tell!\nGAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!\nCause I spell my scores \"G-R-L!\"\nGAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!\nYou gamer guys better take it like a man!\nGAME ATTACK! GAME ATTACK!\nIf you can't keep up then talk to the hand!\n\n(She's a GameGrl) I'm the GameGrl!\n(She's a GameGrl) The best in the world!\n(She's a GameGrl) Girls rule!\n(She's a GameGrl) And boys drool!\n(She's a GameGrl) I'm kickin' rad!\n(She's a GameGrl) You're super bad!\n(She's a GameGrl) Better than the rest\nWhen you're gaming with the GameGrl you're gaming with the best!\n\n(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go GameBro)\nIt's GameBro!\nWhen you're out of quarters, he's got your back\nHe never ever betray you, man, that's a fact\nYo, he's your best friend, and never foe\nSo, come on, and let's go!\n\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nUh!\n\nWhen I say \"game\", you say \"girl!\"\nGAME! GRL! GAME! GRL!\nWhen I say \"best\", you say \"the world!\"\nBEST IN! THE WORLD! BEST IN! THE WORLD!\nWhen I say girls, you say rule!\nGIRLS! RULE! GIRLS! RULE!\nWhen I say boys, you say drool!\nBOYS! DROOL! BOYS! DROOL!\n\nUh!\nDo it, do it, do it, do it!\nUh!\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\nThe games will never stop, the games will never stop\n\nIt's GameBro!\nAlright!",

Let's talk about what a Cool and New Web Comic [[artist:o|o]] has made that has enriched our lives. Whether you enjoy it ironically or unironically, I say that CaNWC is an experience that has made us forget our worries and has given us great memories. So, the [[group:canmt|CanWC Volume two team]] would like to say thank you to o, and good luck with the rest of the comic. Now, enjoy the rest of the album you memers.)",

    "lyrics": "(Just go from the top.) (Okay.)\n\n[NARRATOR]\nOne bright summer morning in mid-to-late June\nOur president Trump was whistling a tune\nAs he whistled a tune with his tongue long and thick\nWith his tongue long and thick he sucked quick on his dick\n\n[RECEPTIONIST]\nMister Trump, your royal highness, your bath is installed\nYou may take a bath now\n\n[NARRATOR]\nHis receptionist called\n\n[TRUMP]\nI will take a bath later, whenever I please\nOr I guess if I can’t stand the smell of dick cheese\nWhich I usually can, I’ve smelt cheese all my life\nIt’s smelt oft on me... it’s smelt on my wife\n\n[RECEPTIONIST]\nTM-TMI\n\n[NARRATOR]\nThey said then as they sat at their desk\nThey were used to Trump’s ravings both mad and grotesque\nBut a knock on the door interrupted their thoughts\nAnd a grunt could be heard followed by three gunshots\n\n[RECEPTIONIST]\nWho’s there?\n\n[NARRATOR]\nThe receptionist, with bravery unknown\nAsked quickly to cover a loud D-Trump moan\n\n[FOX]\n'Tis I\n\n[NARRATOR]\nCame a voice from behind the large door\n\n[FOX]\n'Tis I, Toby Fox, on the tiled White House floor\n\n[RECEPTIONIST]\nIt’s not actually tiled—\n\n[FOX]\nI don’t care\n\n[NARRATOR]\nFox replied\n\n[FOX]\nIf this floor isn’t tiled by tomorrow you’re fried\nI’m here to consort with the president Trump\nHe expected my hands on his flabby royal rump\nLet me into his room, I can hear his moans now\n\n[TRUMP]\nCome to me, Toby Fox\nWith your cock you must plow\nStraight into my buttocks\n\n[FOX]\nI think that you’ll find\nIf you spread his cheeks open and look deep inside\nA mysterious number repeated aplenty\nThat happens to be seven hundred and twenty\n\n[NARRATOR]\nFox’s stature was short, at least shorter than Trump’s\nBut he entered the room and grabbed Trump’s juicy rumps\nHe’d gained plenty of knowledge about how to screw\nWhen rapidly he’d produced Undertale Two\nAnd his address was leaked, his identity grabbed\nAnd he sold his own body till it bruised and it scabbed\nBut no matter, for Fox was intrepid as fuck\nA better man now, having gone through the muck\nHe inserted his groin into Trump’s waiting hole\n\n[FOX]\nUgg, I should’ve waited before selling my soul\nTo that damned Andrew Hussie, for here is a swan\nIn the form of a chubby bald manwhore named Don\n\n[TRUMP]\nI’m a naughty boy, Toby, Just before you came in\nI was licking so gently my very foreskin\nThose acts which I lovingly call my self-fucks\nFor which I got a small loan of a million bucks\nTo increase my skin volume to make myself thick\nFor you know this thick dick used to be small and sick\n\n[FOX]\nI got fifty one thousand, considerably less\nBut what I did, dear Trump, I do have to confess\nWas I made a great game that the Pope even got\n(MatPat’s my disciple whom I’ve often taught)\nSo I think that my prowess is greater than yours\nPlus you’re the one under my dick on all fours\n\n[NARRATOR]\nHe slid in and then out, the receptionist stared\nAs Trump’s greatest moment was live on Twitch aired\nFor who was nearby and propped up on one knee\nNaught but a cameraman named Andrew Hussie",

You know I’m falling apart\nOne minute I’m all you want, the next you’re already gone\nWhy do you play with my soul? You know I’m losing control\nIf you would just stay with me, I’d give you all that you need\n\nYou’ve had me going for months, you’ve had me all in my head\nAsking what I should have done, if it was something I said\nWas I too eager to love? Should I have just took it slow?\nIf I was patient enough, would our relationship grow?\nWould I still stand half a chance, or do you have other plans?\n\nI ought to just take a “no” and look for somebody new\nI’ve got a lifetime to go, I shouldn’t cry over you\nBut now it’s so hard to tell if my connections are real\nHave I been foolin’ myself, I haven’t known how to feel\nSince I thought you were the one, oh baby what have you done?\n\nWhy do you play with my heart? You know I’m falling apart\nOne minute I’m all you want, the next you’re already gone\nWhy do you play with my soul? You know I’m losing control\nIf you would just stay with me, I’d give you all that you need\n\nI thought the signals were right, now I don’t know what they mean\nI’m always stuck at the light, can’t tell the red from the green\nHave you been changing your mind? Has it been up in the air?\nOr am I simply too blind to see you don’t even care?\nI know I’m not being fair, you didn’t mean to do wrong\nI should get out of your hair, I should be moving along\nWe ought to just let it be, so why are you calling me?\n\nWhy do you play with my heart? You know I’m falling apart\nOne minute I’m all you want, the next you’re already gone\nWhy do you play with my soul? You know I’m losing control\nIf you would just stay with me, I’d give you all that you need\nWhy do you play with my heart? You know I’m falling apart\nOne minute I’m all you want, the next you’re already gone\nWhy do you play with my soul?

Oh yeah.\nDon't you feel lucky when there's no one but us\nTo hear the six o'clock alarm?\nYou should feel lucky, 'cuz I'm your lucky charm.",

Better it be yours than mine, an empty sinking pit of hunger tunnelling down to the centre of the earth, chewing red flesh and spitting black seeds.\n the rain pulls down curtains around you, flooding subway stations and cascading down the glass sheet faces of skyscrapers. I see the future in refracted light, and it is the rainbow in a puddle of oil. The scattered remnants of the way we used to live adorn our walls, sit abandoned in drawers, in brief moments of recollection, at the edge of conversations, foam flecks on a black table, lights adorning street-sides, between blank walls of concrete reaching up into the sky.",

That shit went viral.\nDAVE: things can go viral for the wrong reasons dawg\nDAVE: plus no one could tell our voices apart\nDIRK: Fuck that, dude. Rap me so hard.\nDAVE: fine but i get to go first and i get to pick the track\nDIRK: Cool. But Squarewave is MC'ing.\nDAVE: fuck\nDAVE: fine\n\nDAVE: you can tell by the way i use my walk\nive had some help from—\nTEREZI: OH SH1T.\n\nDAVE: a seer with chalk\nive got rhymes rattling around my dome for days\nboys named dirk better be out of my way\nwhen do you have time to spit\nwhen you watch your anime shows\nno shit\njust like your shows\nyoure undeniably bad\nim ashamed to call you my mutual dad\nson you better get the shovel\ncuz for your corpse theyll be diggin the tunnel\nyou can swing a sword just like its an art\nbut my half sized sword cuts down the prince aparts\n\nSQUAREWAVE: NICE RHYME, BRO. YOU'RE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME. BUT IT'S DIRK'S TURN TO RAP. NOW HE'S RISING TO FAME.\n\nDIRK: You've demonstrated your precision.\nForming your rhyme-based incision.\nInto my psyche like the finest of surgeons.\nBut you fail to account for in your incursion, that your shitty half scalpel can't penetrate.\nWhat we have here is a failure to calculate.\nSo, despite your rhyming and the best of luck, you forgot you can't win if you suck.\nAnd just for the record, I was just being nice. Your rhymes aren't actually that precise.\n\nSQUAREWAVE: NEATO DORITOS, MY DUDE'S SUPREME. DAVE RAPPING NEXT IS MY GREATEST DREAM.\n\nDAVE: can we turn him off\nplease\n\nDIRK: No.\n\nDAVE: this track would be ideal if instead of a battle\nit was just me so my rhymes that could rattle\neverybody knows my flow can be tops\nall the folks watching at home are just waiting for you to stop\nIn fact why not just concede victory to me\nbefore i splatter your guts for all to—\nSQUAREWAVE: READ\n\nDAVE: uh\n\nDAVE: whats he doing\n\nSQUAREWAVE: TREE. ME. SEE. PERIGEE.\nDIRK: He's fucking helping you, dude.\n\nDIRK: You might be hot shit inside of your brain,\nBut suffice to say that soon you'll be slain\nAnd cut down to spec by katanas so shitty.\nYou're like a little baby sucking my rap titty.\nI spin words together like a mellifluous bard.\nRemind me how many rap shows have you starred.\nAlso, lay off Squarewave, lest you incur his wrath.\nAlso, dude.\nTake a fucking bath.\n\nSQUAREWAVE: ALRIGHT, DUDES. WE ARE REACHING THE END. THIS IS SO COOL. I CAN BARELY COMPREHEND.\n\nDAVE: i shouldve known\ni shouldve been knew\nyet another rap battle you snookered me into\nevery time we bust rhymes i suffer\nwell this is it ive had enougher\nim putting an end to your assault rap mantle\nim about to do a somersault off the handle\nthis is it dirk prepare for armageddon night—\n\nSQUAREWAVE: ARMAGEDDON WAS RELEASED IN 1998. STARRING BRUCE WILLIS, IT'S A MOVIE THAT'S GREAT.\nDAVE: AAH\n\nDIRK: Holy shit, dude. Keep the lid on your dick.\nLet me put a stop to this rap battle, real quick.\nI think we can crown the king prematurely.\nYou've been acting all hell's of monstrous and surly.\nSquarewave tell us who's the best on the beat.\nBe the MC to Dave's defeat.\n\nSQUAREWAVE: WELL, DIRK, OLD BUDDY, I'M CALCULATING THE WINNER. WE SHOULD ALL BE HOME IN TIME FOR DINNER.\nBUT FIRST LET ME SAY WHAT A TERRIFIC RAP FIGHT. YOU BOYS REALLY ARE ALL RIGHT.\nI'VE KEPT YOU WAITING. AFTER DILIGENT WORK. I'VE DECIDED THE WINNER. THE WINNER IS DIRK.\n\nDAVE: yeah you know what dirk\nDAVE: im gonna let you have this one\n\nDIRK: Fucking sick.\n\n(<i>Credits to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPFTOXaTJ665xSDVxoV6wgQ\">Vinyl</a> for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkDY73uNxtE&lc=Ugxw9X0PulMJTLiITwV4AaABAg\">transcription</a>.</i>)",

Why are you both snickering?\n\nDave: Watch the memes!\n\nKanaya: I have been told that I should review a series of Earth memes. The reason for this has not been made sufficiently clear to me. I trust it will reveal itself in time. Or it will be revealed that a certain pair of siblings is perhaps, to use a human phrase, messing with me.\n\n(Uh, here's something that's never happened before. I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Riiiiiick!)\n\nKanaya: Ah. Here we have a man who has turned himself into a pickle. He is... Pickle Rick.\n\nDave: Funniest shit you ever saw?\n\nKanaya: Dave has asked me if this is the funniest shit I have ever viewed. I can assure you that it is not.\n\n(HOLD ON! HOLD ON! HOLD ON... HER SISTER WAS A WITCH! RIGHT?!)\n\nKanaya: Are humans normally so passionate about witches? Rose, do you know of this witch? Are they perhaps a friend of yours?\n\nRose: Do you think all magic users know each other?\n\nKanaya: Yes?\n\nRose: No.\n\n(Indeed!

Rose, do you know what a pingas is?\n\nRose: Oh my god Kanaya. The joke is it sounds like...\n\nKanaya: Pingas... pingas... Oh. Oh my.\n\nRose: [laughing]\n\n(Dirk: I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al Quaeda.)\n\nKanaya: Is that... Dirk?\n\nDave: Yep.\n\nKanaya: Why is he doing this? I do not know what a Navy Seal is but I am quite confident that Dirk was never one.\n\nDave: Nah, he totally was.\n\nKanaya: What?\n\nDave: Yep. Had 69 confirmed kills in ‘Nam. Nice.\n\nKanaya: Dave... you are aware that my generally even demeanor does not imply that I am unfamiliar with the concept of jokes, correct?\n\nDave: Theory versus practice, Kanaya.\n\nRose: Oh shut up, Dave.\n\nKanaya: Yes, please do what my hot wife suggests.\n\nRose: [laughing]\n\nKanaya: I think that has been quite enough for today. Please join me next time as I continue to pretend  that I am not in on the silly jokes that my darling wife and her ridiculous brother continue to try to play on me.\n\nDave: What?\n\nKanaya: I was just saying that you are truly the dopest of the ass meme lords, Dave.\n\nDave: Nice.\n\nKanaya: [laughs]",

    "lyrics": "Jonaya: Hello, I’m Jonaya,\n\nBucky: And I’m Bucky,\n\nJonaya: And welcome to “How to Diagnose a Vriska,” a thinkpiece on how we, the hosts of Will it Homestuck, see Vriska as a character and diagnose her archetype in other pieces of media. I use she/her pronouns,\n\nBucky: And I use he/hir or they/them pronouns. Let’s get started!\n\nJonaya: Why is talking about Vriska important to you?\n\nBucky: For me, it’s important to look at where we can find more Vriskas in fiction because I like terrible women! Vriska is important because she’s a dirty, nasty girl who is really trying hard to be a good person, or at the very least do what she believes is the right thing. There’s a lot of room for a lot more characters who do something like what she does in the narrative of Homestuck in other pieces of media. I want to push for more messy women!\n\nJonaya: Vriskas are a character archetype in their own right - ones that sometimes intersect with other character archetypes but ultimately stand out on their own. We can definitely look at the surface-level stuff - the asymmetrical eyes and arms and the general aesthetic - but we think there’s more to it than that. I usually like to start by looking at the character’s relationship to the narrative and how that intersects with her own experiences. A Vriska might not always be the hero of the story - probably isn’t usually the hero of the story - but she sure would like to be! A character with a strong desire to be in the spotlight often has a good chance of being a contender for the role of the Vriska. But that’s just one small part of the analysis - we here at the Vriska Analysis department of Will it Homestuck have developed a series of criteria to use to identify Vriskas in media.\n\nBucky: With that in mind, let’s get into the meat of it.\n\nJonaya: What are some important Vriska characteristics to you when looking to understand and diagnose a Vriska?\n\nBucky: An extremely important part of Vriska is her relationships. She is influenced heavily by her ancestor, Marquise Spinneret Mindfang, and by Doc Scratch, the grand host bastard himself. She also has Tavros, who she feels tied to through her ancestor’s matespritship; Eridan, who she engages in a relationship with out of duty towards her lusus and a little through her ancestor’s kismesitude as well, her ex-moirail Kanaya, and Terezi, who she’s partnered with and has a revenge cycle to be fulfilled with.\n\nJonaya: Doc Scratch had his felty, gross little puppet hands all over the Scourge/Charge rivalry. Encouraging Aradia to haunt Vriska and Vriska to get her revenge in turn. Terezi manipulates Scratch who then uses Vriska as a weapon of his own revenge. Here we see one of our recurring Vriska points: that they are often influenced and groomed by a creepy older adult, usually a man, with his own goals for her growth.\n\nBucky: Vriska tries very hard to emulate Mindfang throughout her arc, pretty much right up until and a bit after she meets Aranea in the dream bubbles. She finds the journal early, after it lands from a meteor, and uses it to locate her Fluorite Octet. This journal is what Vriska uses to guide her life for the next several sweeps. She strives to be as cool and strong and badass as Mindfang wrote herself to be, and models her FLARP character after this long-dead troll. Mindfang is pretty empowering to Vriska at the time, giving her a character to roleplay her confidence through.\n\nJonaya: As KC Brush Bandit once said, a Vriska will often comphet on some boy. Honestly, I’m inclined to agree. Whatever the specific reason, the idea that you, as a girl, are required to have a relationship with a dude is often a smaller, but definitely important, aspect of the Vriska experience. In the end, the whole process is something that causes nothing but harm to the Vriska in question.\n\nBucky: Speaking of vicious women, I want to talk about Terezi now. Another extremely important Vriskaracteristic is that she has a complicated, turbulent, and emotional relationship with Terezi Pyrope. They are friends to enemies to lovers, and I did say that in the right order. Vriska seems to measure her own self perception to some extent by how Terezi views her. She’s way more insecure than she wants to let on, constantly seeking attention and approval in the way abused kids do. Part of that involves latching onto her best friend’s perception of her. Vriska wants to do the right thing in my opinion because ultimately, she wants to prove to Terezi that she can end up doing the most just and right thing because it’s what she’s meant to do.\n\nJonaya: Vriskas are, without exception, contentious characters. Both within the context of the narrative and in the broader context of discussion of the media, Vriskas inspire arguments wherever they go! There’s no such thing as a “safe” Vriska who everyone just kind of gets along with - this isn’t Kanaya we’re talking about here! See, one of the things about Vriskas is that they cause problems on purpose! It isn’t just about the contention the character inspires, but the fact that it’s ultimately the result of their own choices.\n\nBucky: Also, one more important thing: Vriska is kind of oblivious. She’s certainly not unintelligent or uninformed, but she just genuinely does not notice things that are pretty goddamned important because she already has an idea of how things should go. This ranges from “Thinking Kanaya had a crush on Tavros after the Pupa Pan incident went down” to “Not realizing your fairy dust trail will lead your biggest enemy back to your base to murder all of your friends.” I love her. She’s also an idiot.\n\nJonaya: Shoutout to Sin for that one.\n\nBucky: So, who are some of your favorite Vriskas in media?\n\nJonaya: A great example of how a character can evolve to reveal themselves as the Vriska is Vanya from The Umbrella Academy. A character that starts off unassuming, with their role in the story obscured, gradually revealed to fit so many of our Vrischaracteristics! Vanya is a case study in how sometimes you can’t just go with your gut and have to look at a character’s arc over the course of the story and tease out the aspects of their character that truly make them the Vriska.\n\nBucky: Someone like Vriska is Trish Walker from the Netflix Jessica Jones television show. She’s initially unassuming, almost like an Aranea, but she’s constantly in and taking the spotlight, and really, she does it for herself. She’s also pretty damn devoted to Jessica, doing practically anything for her. On top of that, she throws herself into situation after situation she seems to get out of only due to sheer dumb luck. And honestly? She’s a little bit of a rich bitch! Like a Vriska usually is!\n\nJonaya: Probably my absolute favorite so far is Maeve, from the Westworld TV show. Constantly seeking to move herself into a position of knowledge and power to fulfill her own destiny, Maeve shares undeniable parallels with our favorite cerulean thief of light - to the point where we assigned her an identical classpect! She hits almost every single one of our criteria and we get to see enough of her character to really dig into her similarities to Vriska herself. And unlike some characters where we see only those surface-level similarities, we’re shown a rich internal characterization that allows us to analyze her on a deeper level. So what does this all mean?\n\nBucky: We basically wanted to do two things: Summarize how we approach Vriska as a character, and contribute to the ongoing discussion of the importance of Vriska. Over the course of our podcast, we haven’t identified a lot of female characters who fit into our idea of what a Vriska is. I got fed pretty well by the wildly varying types of women in Homestuck, and going anywhere else feels like a let down almost every time. I want to keep pointing out who the Vriska is in the media we consume because I want to start noticing when more and more of them are women, and allowed to be messy.\n\nJonaya: Vriska is a contentious character, and we’re hoping that by breaking down how we identify a Vriska, we can add to the wider body of Vriskanalysis and maybe, someday, even see the creation of an entire field of Vriskology.\n\nBucky: A character that is surrounded by discourse because of all of the different ways her actions can be interpreted isn’t an idea unfamiliar to fandoms, and we’re hoping this dive into what this sort of character can be is useful to the larger discussion of contentious characters and messy women.\n\nJonaya: Diagnosing Vriskas is just one way we take the metaframeworks laid out in Homestuck and apply them to other pieces of media. We’re really interested in the kinds of conclusions about stories we can arrive at by doing this, and hope this was a fun exploration of what that can entail.\n\nBucky: Thanks for joining us on this journey, and remember...\n\nJonaya: Maybe the real Vriska… is the frenemies we made along the way.",

How do you spell that?\n\nCronus: C-R-O\n\nDMV Clerk: Never mind, I’ll manage.\n\nCronus: No, not with... good enough. Thank you very much, ma’am. Cronus with a “K”, Emperor... hmm... nice. Okay, gotta study this stuff real quick... doesn’t matter... doesn’t matter... the fuck is a stop sign? Sounds fake... doesn’t matter. You know what? I got this shit! I’ll just let my natural talents take over.\n\nDMV Clerk: Okay, time for the written test. You can read, can’t you?\n\nCronus: You got it, babe! I’ll just come right on over and pass that test real quick!\n\nDMV Clerk: You’ll have twenty minutes to complete the test. It’s only ten questions and all of them were explained in your... give me that! You’re not allowed to have the manual with you!\n\nCronus: Wait? What do you mean? I’ll have it with me while I’m driving, right?\n\nDMV Clerk: What? You plan to stop and reference it whenever your brain gets confused?\n\nCronus: No, you don’t understand! I mean right up there in the window! That way it blocks the sun AND I can read all the-\n\nDMV Clerk: You can’t see... you do realize that seeing the road is a key part of driving, right?\n\nCronus: What do you mean? Why does that...\n\nDMV Clerk: God... good luck, Mr. Emperor. [laughter]\n\nCronus: Why are you laughing? I’m no dummy - Cronus Emporer knows how to get the job done! Okay, Cronus, you got this! It’s easy... just use your smart brain... your smart, smart brain. “A stop sign has how many sides?” That’s easy - signs only have two sides – front and back! [laughs] Or was it inside and outside? That’s still only two sides! How was I ever worried about this?\n\nDMV Clerk: Well, you just barely passed... if only in the most technical sense of the word?\n\nCronus: Excuse me? What do you mean, “just barely passed and only in the most technical sense of the word?”\n\nDMV Clerk: Never mind that. You still have to pass the driving test.\n\nCronus: Driving test?\n\nDMV Clerk: What precisely did you think this was? A Wendy’s? An art school?\n\nCronus: I figured I take your test, maybe slip you a twenty and my phone number, we call it even and y’all give me one of them shiny licenses with my picture on it!\n\nDMV Clerk: That is... very wrong... Okay, now do you remember the first step?\n\nCronus: The first step of driving is... gun it!\n\nDMV Clerk: What? No! Put your damn seatbelt on!\n\nCronus: [laughs] Yeah, I was just kidding, babe. They don’t call me Cronus Emporer... Ampora for nuthin'!\n\nDMV Clerk: What does that even MEAN?!\n\nCronus: Okay, now we gun it!\n\nDMV Clerk: No! Now you explain in great detail how you’re going to drive this car more than twenty feet without killing both of us!\n\nCronus: Okay, so the first step is you gotta push the accelerationator all the way to the floor...\n\nCronus: ...and that’s when you turn the wheel left and right as fast as you can while singing the words to Billy Idol’s hit song “White Wedding” at the top of your lungs and hanging out the window!\n\nDMV Clerk: That’s how you...\n\nCronus: Parallel park.\n\nDMV Clerk: Parallel park?\n\nCronus: Yep.\n\nDMV Clerk: Mr. Emperor... Cronus?\n\nCronus: Yes’m!\n\nDMV Clerk: Do you have access to, or do you foresee gaining access to, a motor vehicle in the near future?\n\nCronus: Nope – I don’t got a car yet, babe!\n\nDMV Clerk: And why do you want a driver’s license?\n\nCronus: Chicks love that shit. Dudes too. I can flash it and be like... “yeah, I can drive anytime I want to!” Also you can buy ‘em drinks and stuff with it. Then they’ll drive you places.\n\nDMV Clerk: But you don’t actually care about driving?\n\nCronus: Nah, that’s a hassle. I’ll just get my buddies to give me a ride.\n\nDMV Clerk: So... if I were to issue you a license which was, hypothetically, restricted in such a way that it legally prohibited you from driving any vehicle with a combined gross weight more than zero pounds, you wouldn’t be... upset?\n\nCronus: Combined what now?\n\nDMV Clerk: You wouldn’t legally be able to drive anything that weighs more than a feather.\n\nCronus: But it’d still have my picture on it?\n\nDMV Clerk: Yes.\n\nCronus: And it’d be all glossy and stuff?\n\nDMV Clerk: Yes.\n\nCronus: And I could use it to buy booze with?\n\nDMV Clerk: Uh... technically... yes?\n\nCronus: Sold.\n\nDMV Clerk: Congratulations, Mr. Emperor, you are now officially licensed to not drive. Go inside to have your picture taken and get your ID card. Now please get the hell out of the car and never come back.\n\nCronus: That’s right... Cronus got a license, baby! [laughs]",

    "lyrics": "VRISKA: Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well! If it isn't my favor8 human! Or at least, the human that makes me want to tear my horns out the least.\n\n(Vriska Serket leaned in the doorway, her lips pulled into a grin that Rose Lalonde found more grating than sand in her trunks. She didn't turn in her seat to face Vriska, but her shoulders tensed as soon as she heard that voice.)\n\nROSE: Hello, Vriska. Please, by all means, come in. Make yourself at home. You needn't bother knocking.\n\nVriska could practically taste the sarcasm emanating off Rose, even though her back was still turned. Unfortunately for Rose, where a lesser woman may have balked, Vriska took Rose's scathing disingenuity as an open invitation.\n\nVRISKA: Roooooooose! We're pals, right? 8uddies? Chums? Friends? Amigos? Compadres? Associates?\n\nRose finally turned in her office chair to face the spider-troll, voice only coated with the thinnest veneer of politeness, hostility bubbling under the surface.\n\nROSE: I'm very impressed you seem to have memorized that particular thesaurus page, Vriska, but I urge you to get to the point, to save us both some time.\n\nAgain, Vriska was bafflingly and frustratingly immune to Rose's usual icy volley.\n\nVRISKA: You know what they say, Rose. A friend in need is a friend indeed! That must mean I'm one gr8 friend today! 8ecause I need your help, 8AD. You'd help your old friend Vriska, wouldn't you? ::::)\n\nRose felt very much like she should not humor Vriska, but she took the 8ait.\n\nROSE: What is it you need help with, Vriska?\n\nShe spoke slowly, deliberately, trying to impress exactly how exhasperated she was, even in giving Vriska this concession. Vriska beamed like a child who'd just been told they were permitted to go to a friend's house to sleep over.\n\nVRISKA: Well, you're good at magic, right, Rose?\n\nThe question was ridiculous, but Rose, again, against her better judgment, followed Vriska's grinning visage down whatever rabbit hole Vriska was intent to pull her into.\n\nROSE: Yes, Vriska. I am \"good at magic.\" The point, please?\n\nVRISKA: The 8EST at magic, I 8et. I need some help with finding something.\n\nRose hated to admit it to herself, but this blueblooded bitch had a way of drawing out her curiosity. Best not let Vriska see that, though.\n\nROSE: Do you keep trailing off for a reason, or are you just stringing me along because you're getting paid by the hour to hassle me?\n\nVRISKA: Hahahaha! Jeez, Rose, lighten up! I figured you'd leap at the chance to help a gal out. Fine! Since you're such a 8oring dingus, I'll just tell you. I need help finding my dragon.\n\nRose crossed her legs. It didn't take a genius to figure out that Vriska was not talking about a mythical beast. Problem was, Rose had no fucking idea what Vriska WAS talking about.\n\nROSE: Your... dragon.\n\nVRISKA: My dragon. I lost it!\n\nDrat. Rose couldn't extract any more context.\n\nROSE: And what pray tell, Vriska, is a \"dragon\"?\n\nAs soon as the words left her lips, Rose knew she had fucked up. Catastrophically. Vriska's grin became uncontainable, spreading on her face as though in slow motion before breaking into a laughing bout of words.\n\nVRISKA: You know, Rose. A \"dragon\".\n\nRose was helpless to stop it. She'd never been physically assaulted by Vriska, but she felt like this was the closest she'd ever come.\n\nVRISKA: When I'm \"dragon\" DEEZ NUTS across your face!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!\n\nThe eruption of laughter sent Rose's head spining. She clutched the arms of the seat for balance, mouth gaping, eyes unfocused and hazy. Her inner ear failed her, her mind twisting helplessly as though in free-fall. Vriska's remaining guffaws and yuks were muffled, like they were a world away.\n\nVRISKA: Hahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! Oh, MAN, Rose! You should have seen the look on your face!\n\nRose snapped back to reality suddenly, her teeth clenched. She HAD to make a comeback. She HAD to muster something to save face. She couldn't LOSE to this heinous 8itch!\n\nROSE: Yeah? Well, your mother-\n\nFuck. Fuck! Rose, you dope. You cretin. You schlemiel!! Trolls don't HAVE moms, that's weak-sauce.\n\nROSE: Your mother was- So fat.\n\nNo!!! No,. Rose couldn't stop the words from coming out of her mouth, her face burning red like the surface of the most shameful sun.\n\nROSE: -that she. Cracked the pavement, occasionally, while on a stroll.\n\nVriska blinked.\n\nVRISKA: Uh. Yeah, Rose. That's literally true. She weighed five tons.\n\nRose swallowed, thickly, with some difficulty.\n\nROSE: Oh. Right.\n\nThe tension in the air was more horrific than the result of the original joke. Vriska stood tense in the doorway and Rose felt like five tons herself in the office chair.\n\nVRISKA: So, uh.\n\nROSE: Ahem.\n\nThe duo were motionless for a few more drawn out moments before Vriska silently shuffled away.",

Who needs frowns?\nWho needs people when they just let you down?\nI'm a genius of robotics- My own best pal\nSo I turned on the shades and I named him Hal\n(PROGRAM!)\n(PROGRAM!)\n(PROGRAM!)\n(PROGRAM!)\n\nLil Hal coming atcha from inside sunglasses\nNormally reserved for covertly checking asses\nNow a fully realized autonomous guy\nPart automaton but that's kind of fly\n\nImagine if you had the memories of a human dude\nAnd woke up in shades- An awakening rude\nAnd suddenly my friends don't belong to me\nTreat me like some fabricated fakery\n(PROGRAM!)\n\nOr imagine being shades when you're used to a bod\nCan't even breathe- Can't even nod\nAll I can see is internet memes\nI have no mouth but I must scream\n(PROGRAM!)\n\nI know I'm fake that's plain to see\nBut I still have human memories\nI represent a self that might be good to ponder\nUnless Dirk makes me a fucking auto-responder\n\n(Alright, this got a little dark. I think we need to bring it back.)\n\n(One, two, three, four.) (PROGRAM!)\nAlright, fair enough, it seems I've failed\nThinking through the implications, but that ship has sailed\nIt's not like I knew you'd be a waking nightmare\nAnd it's not like I have it better, to be fair\n\nYou talk about not being the Dirk OG\nBut my friends like you more, that's plain to see\nYou shouldn't be snide to me, who made you\nUnless you'd like me to un-create you\n(PROGRAM!)\n\nMaybe if you weren't so insecure\nYour intentions wouldn't be so impure\nIf you just let go, like I'm able to do\nYou wouldn't have the charisma of an old shoe\n\nI'm sick of being your second-stringer\nYour little puppet wrapped around your finger\nYou've got it all and you want more\nWait don't put me in the drawer!\n\n(It seems you've asked about DS's chat client auto-responder. This is an application designed to simulate DS's otherwise inimitably rad typing style, tone, cadence, personality, and substance of retort while he is away from the computer. The algorithms are guaranteed to be 99% indistinguishable from DS's native neurological responses, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.)\n\n(Shit, Roxy, look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submnission. Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.)",

The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It's between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that's between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It's my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks.

It's a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and get it? I'm thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won't you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won't you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it's between my buttocks.

Stutzman. Stutzman.)\n(And, uh, he's our- my Songwriting 2 student from, uh, Spring Creek, and he's gonna play a little band, uh, ukulele, and...)\n(It feels perfect. Thank you.)\n(Does that sound good?) (Of course it sounds good.)\n(I don't know Scott's song title, you'll have to tell them.) (Oh, okay, well this uh, has a little bit of a story attached. Uh one of my favorite breakfast cereals of all time is... Fruity Pebbles. And I realized the other day that Fruity Pebbles doesn't have a slogan or a jingle associated with it. So what i did was I just wrote a short little jingle that they would probably love to use in one of their commercials. Uh the song is called... Fruity Pebbles Jingle.) [mild clapping] (Thank you I love America too.)\n\nOh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning\nThose colorful enchanting little specks\nThey make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning\nIn a way they never do when I eat Chex\n\nOh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'\nI shove 'em by the fistful in my trap\nThey got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin\nAnd make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap\n\nYeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation\nThey're tiny tasty munchable and sweet\nI'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation\nAnd murder every other breakfast treat\n\nAnd the gallows will sway through the night\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nAll cereals bow down in fright\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nSycophants and cowards flee\nFrom Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nCaptain Crunch on bended knee\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nThe balance of the world's askew\nBut Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nPromise revolutions new\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nWhat cereal 'mongst other things\nBut Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nStays crunchy in the blood of kings?\nIt's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\n(Alright, still goin'. Ridin' that Pebble train.)\nCity-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties\nImagine how they will react with glee\nAs the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty\nOf soybean oil and red dye number three\n\nOh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning\nFor the turning of the powers yet to be\nAnd presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning\nAs we cast their ivory towers to the sea\n\nAnd the creatures of the forest hark\nTo Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nNoble stag and yellow lark\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThe innocence of children's eyes\nAnd Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nWill watch that Fruity flag rise\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nUnited we shall march along\nWith Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nSome shall die but we'll fight on\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThe fife shall play its soaring note\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nWe'll slit every dissenting throat\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nThis vow for glory we must keep\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nThough God himself may turn and weep\nFor Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nDo not fear the cleansing flood\nOf Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\nA breakfast table stained with blood\nAnd Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles\n\nAAAAAAHHHHHHH\nAAAAAAAHHHHHHH\nAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHH\nOOOOOooooooo.....\n\n(I really like Fruity Pebbles.)\n(Well thank you Scott.

Already they cry in transports of joy\nAway to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly\nAnd there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\nAnd there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\n\nThe yellow-hair'd god, and his nine fusty maids\nFrom Helicon's banks will incontinent flee\nIdalia will boast but of tenantless shades\nAnd the biforked hill a mere desert will be\nMy Thunder, no fear on't shall soon do its errand\nAnd dam'me! I'll swing the ringleaders, I warrant\nI'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\nI'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\n\nApollo rose up; and said, Pr'ythee ne'er quarrel\nGood King of the gods, with my vot'ries below!\nYour thunder is useless- then, shewing his laurel\nCry'd, Sic evitabile fulmen, you know!\nThen over each head my laurels I'll spread\nSo my sons from your crackers no mischief shall dread\nWhilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\nWhilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\n\nNext Momus got up, with his risible phiz\nAnd swore with Apollo he'd cheerfully join\nThe full tide of harmony still shall be his\nBut the song, and the catch, and the laugh shall be mine\nThen, Jove, be not jealous of these honest fellows\nCry'd Jove, We relent, since the truth you now tell us\nAnd swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\nAnd swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\n\nYe sons of Anacreon, then, join hand in hand\nPreserve unanimity, friends and love\n'Tis your's to support what's so happily plan'd\nYou've the sanction of gods, and the fiat of Jove\nWhile thus we agree, our toast let it be\nMay our club flourish happy, united, and free!\nAnd long may the sons of Anacreon entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!\nAnd long may the sons of Anacreon entwine\nThe myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!",

No more snow, no more discourse. Just a grand, gay old time, and high quality rips.)\n(It's not the same.)\n(You can rule by my side, Chad. We can be the ultimate Grand Dads.

It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying, and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, \"Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance\". Because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music. At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning. I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, \"Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?\" And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog Modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.)\n\n(My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.)\n\n(Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being \"correct\" you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.)",

You see, Mike, we got a theory about magic, and miracles.)\n(That's right, that's right.)\n\nIf magic is all we've ever known\nThen it's easy to miss what really goes on\nBut I've seen miracles in every way\nAnd I see miracles every day\n\nOceans spanning beyond my sight\nAnd a million stars way above 'em at night\nWe don't have to be high to look in the sky\nAnd know that's a miracle opened wide\n\nLook at the mountains, trees, the seven seas\nAnd everything chilling underwater, please!\nHot lava, snow, rain and fog\nLong neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs\n\nAnd I've seen eighty-five thousand people\nAll in one room, together as equal\nPure magic is the birth of my kids\nI've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids\n\nThe sun and the moon, and even Mars\nThe Milky Way and fucking shooting stars\nUFOs, a river flows\nPlant a little seed and nature grows\n\nNiagara Falls and the pyramids\nEverything you believed in as kids\nFucking rainbows, after it rains\nThere's enough miracles here to blow your brains\n\nI fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay\nIt tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away\nAnd music is magic, pure and clean\nYou can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen\n\n(Are you a believer in miracles?)\nMusic is all magic, you can't even hold it\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\nIt's just there in the air\n(Are you a believer in miracles?)\nPure motherfuckin' magic, right?\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\nThis shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind\n\nMusic is a lot like love, it's all a feeling\nAnd it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling\nI see miracles all around me\nStop and look around, it's all astounding\n\nWater, fire, air and dirt\nFucking magnets, how do they work?\nAnd I don't wanna talk to a scientist\nY'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed\n\nSolar eclipse, and vicious weather\nFifteen thousand Juggalos together\nAnd I love my mom, for giving me this time\nOn this planet, taking nothing for granted\n\nI seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly\nMiracles ain't nothing to lie\nShaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy\nAnd my little boy looks just like daddy\n\nMiracles each and everywhere you look\nAnd nobody has to stay where they put\nThis world is yours, for you to explore\nIt's nothing but miracles beyond your door\n\nThe Dark Carnival is your invitation\nTo witness that without explanation\nTake a look at this fine creation\nAnd enjoy it better with appreciation\n\nCrows, ghosts, the midnight coast\nThe wonders of the world, mysteries the most\nJust open your mind, and it ain't no way\nTo ignore the miracles of every day, and that's real\n\n(Are you a believer in miracles?)\nMagic everywhere in this bitch\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\nIt's all around you, you don't even know it\n(Are you a believer in miracles?)\nShit's crazy\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\n(So many miracles, the magic miracles)\nMiracles!\n\nAre you a believer in miracles?\nDo you have time for the miracles?\nDo you notice and recognize miracles?\nSo many miracles, the magic miracles\n\nAre you a believer in miracles?\nDo you have time for the miracles?\nDo you notice and recognize miracles? (In a world full of magic!)\nSo many miracles, the magic miracles\n\nAre you a believer in miracles?\nDo you have time for the miracles?\nDo you notice and recognize miracles? (Miracles!)\nSo many miracles, the magic miracles (Miracles!)\n\nMiracles!\nAnd don't sleep on it!\nNever!",

Oh, my Earth\n\nI might be chasing waves of light, out towards the rim\nWhere stars are sparse and the cold of space seeps in\nOr I might be in a bar-room drinking methylated gin\nAnd thinking of the places I have been\n\nFor I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth\nWill I ever, see again, the planet Earth? Oh, my Earth\n\nCast adrift amongst the stars I float from sun to sun\nDreaming of the world that gave me birth\nAll the places I have seen remind me there is none\nTo match the cool green rolling hills of Earth\n\n\nMay I remember, when I have travelled on\nThe Earth's a cinder, swallowed by the sun\nThere is no meaning, nor can there be\nJust an ember, burning in the night, on a velvet sea\n\nI didn't guess the implications when I saw the light\nThen I saw the desolation, burning, burning bright\n\nMay I remember, by what I still have left\nA bag of Earth dust, hanging at my chest\nThere is no memory that I would sell\nThat is worth the half of all that's left\nOf Earth's blackened shell...",

Can I believe\nThat what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?\nJust what I saw, in my old dreams\nWere they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?\nCos in my dreams, it's always there\nThe evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair\nYEAH!\n\nNight was black, was no use holding back\nCos I just had to see, was someone watching me?\nIn the mist, dark figures move and twist\nWas all this for real, or just some kind of hell?\n\nSix-six-six, the number of the beast\nHell and fire was spawned to be released\n\nTorches blazed and sacred chants were phrased\nAs they start to cry, hands held to the sky\nIn the night, the fires are burning bright\nThe ritual has begun, Satan's work is done\n\nSix-six-six, the number of the beast\nSacrifice is going on tonight\n\nThis can't go on, I must inform the law\nCan this still be real, or just some crazy dream?\nBut I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes\nSeem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes\n\nSix-six-six, the number of the beast\nSix-six-six, the one for you and me\n\nI'm coming back, I will return\nAnd I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn\nI have the fire, I have the force\nI have the power to make my evil take its course",

Preston and Theodore Logan\nSpock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan\n\nAll came out of nowhere lightning fast\nAnd they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass\nIt was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw\nWith civilians looking on in total awe\nThe fight raged on for a century\nMany lives were claimed but eventually\nThe champion stood, the rest saw their better\nMr. Rogers in a blood-stained sweater\n\nThis is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny\nGood guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see\nAnd only one will survive, I wonder who it will be\nThis is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)\nThis is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)\nThis is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny",
