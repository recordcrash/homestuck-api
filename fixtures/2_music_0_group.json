    "description": "Albums released on Homestuck's official Bandcamp: the canon foundational to and long inspiring its massive fan community.\n<hr class=\"split\">\nCoinciding (probably coincidentally) with the launch of <a href=\"https://homestuck2.com/\">Homestuck^2</a>, on 25 October 2019 (10/25, a.k.a. [[flash:4109]] Day), the majority of then-released Homestuck albums were combined and re-released as compilation albums. (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dn0jo6/bandcamp_just_rereleased_a_bunch_of_albums_with/\">Source!</a>)\nUndeniably, this was a practical move for those new to the discography, or looking to complete a collection, since the compiled albums were also considerably reduced in price. However, much was lost in terms of presentation: besides the cover arts of merged album releases being dropped due to the nature of the format, much more mysteriously vanished were <i>all</i> track art!\nNo official word was given regarding purposes for this distancing, but the consequences were clear: these compilations were the future; fan-contributed track art would be left in the past.\nWith no ill intent towards those in charge of managing the Bandcamp, we (alongside many fans) found this disheartening, and more than a little disrespectful towards the effort and creativity of the fans responsible for the wonderful gallery of art created for Homestuck's expansive discography. So, when official decisions baffled, fans took action and tried something different; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dwtc4w/i_made_a_wiki_for_homestuck_albums_including/\">we released the Homestuck Music Wiki for the first time</a> on 15 November 2019, just three weeks after the Bandcamp restructure.\nSince then, we've been working with a variety of community members (listeners and musicians alike!) to improve and expand the wiki ever further; today, we hope it stands both a practical resource and a celebratory testament to the history - and future - of Homestuck music!",

    "description": "Albums created by the Homestuck fan community, released independently.\n<hr class=\"split\">\nThe fandom of Homestuck has been creating music since before Homestuck's own conception ([[track:problem-sleuth-theme|yes, really!]]); originally sharing music around the (now-defunct) MSPA Forums via Tindeck (also defunct), learning musicians would practice their skills writing tunes and sharing them with community members. Andrew Hussie would call for contributors to an official soundtrack for the comic (which would, of course, set the stage for Homestuck's [[site:flash/|revered Flash animations]]); musicians would share their work, and the best were picked to join a group known as the Homestuck Music Team. And all the while, fans kept writing, collaborating, and sharing their own music.\nThe first album to find a distinctly <i>unofficial</i> album release was [[album:homestuck-for-the-holidays]]; it was a Christmas-themed album put together by members of the Homestuck Music Team, released to a new Bandcamp, <a href=\"https://homestuckgaiden.bandcamp.com/\">Homestuck Gaiden</a>, on 25 December 2010. Half a year later, this would become the home for an altogether new idea, pioneered by [[artist:elaine-wang]]: the Homestuck <i>fan-album</i>.\n(That story is really hers to tell, and that she did in the introduction to the [[album:lofam]] booklet. Give it a visit!)\nWith the ball now rolling, fan musicians were creating and collaborating more than ever before; now they weren't just making music for themselves and for each other, to be shared on only a single colossal forum thread - their music would have a home!\nThe community grew ever stronger and larger from there, and the albums below are just a portion of the result. With a fair amount of luck, this wiki has come to be a second home for the albums we share; we encourage you to explore: delve deep, find yourself lost, and discover something new!",

Some began personal discographies; some scored games and other new projects, finding followings altogether anew; some joined together, collaboratively creating in a spirit inspired by the comic community's own fan-groups.\nEach of these musicians found roots in Homestuck, in time branching out beyond; the albums in this area of the wiki are a small selection of what they've gone on to create. We encourage you to delve in and explore; every album is its own unique work, and many familiar faces await within!",
